Take it! It will be beneficial to you even if you don't end up studying computer science; always good to have some background in Java
Good if you have limited experience with coding. Assignments are fun and Lab tutorss are always helpful.
I would recommend just preparing to dedicate a lot of time to this class.
"Assignments can be tough, but Lab tutors's and office hours are super helpful in understanding the material!"
This class does not take much time if you have taken computer science before. The content only gets new in the very end compared to the APCS curriculum. Would recommend it to everyone interested in CS as the structure of the class makes it very easy for you to seek help and do well if you put in the effort.
"This is a great course. Taking it online was not a problem, and the lectures were very interesting. Having experience in Java is a big plus and saves a lot of time. A lot of the topics in CS101 were very new to me, even after taking AP Computer Science A in high school. I recommend this to any student with an interest in coding."
Not particularly friendly for people completely new to CS but the material and assignments are all really fun in general.
"Make sure to ask for help sooner than later, especially if you are newer to coding. The staff are all very helpful with clarifying questions, and make sure to go back and review the material weekly so that the information isn't data dumped. I would also say to take advantage of the other learning opportunities and sources of help, such as tutors's for assignments, and study groups. Lastly, I would say to start the assignments not too early in the week, but definitely well before the deadline in order to leave room to ask for help."
Watch the lectures!
Understand the theory; read the textbook; go to labTas for help with assignments
"This course is a great course to dip your feet into computer science. The catch is that I do feel like it goes through topics very fast. I took AP Computer Science in high school and was therefore able to get through the class with many topics being review, but it does seem quite fast for someone without coding experience. However, it is definitely a very useful class, and there is a lot of support for anyone who needs it."
"Take this class if you are interested in CS! Although it is fast-paced, office hours and precept classes are always there to help out! Stay focused and engaged during labs and precept and you should be golden!"
"Good class, lots of work"
Students who are new to coding will need to dedicate a good chunk of time to CS 101 daily.
"If you have no prior knowledge and you are attending other heavier courses, do not take this; otherwise, enjoy!"
"CS101 is a great introduction to computer science. It covers a lot of content very quickly, so make sure you keep up with the material. The assignments are fun and manageable!"
"I strongly recommend you take this course only if you have prior coding experience. Otherwise, get started with a peer tutor as soon as possible."
Watch the lecture as soon as possible and don't fall behind.
"Don't start your assignments too late, go to tutors hours if you need help. Make sure you understand the code you write and don't just be content with getting the assignment done (if you do, it'll come back to bite you on the exams). Ed is also a great resource, so use it!!"
"Make sure to fully understand the first few weeks of material, whether it is through rewatching the lectures, reading the textbook, or redoing labs as understanding this material is of prime importance as information quickly builds on itself in this course. Make sure to devote enough time to the weekly assignments and study well for the exams as they are quite difficult."
"This class is a great introduction for CS, although I think it would a bit challenging for those who haven't taken AP CS before. They fly through AP CS content in the first couple of weeks, and the second half is mostly theory (which most people have no experience with). The assignments are challenging but definitely manageable (especially if you do the second half of assignments with a partner). In terms of the course, you should focus heavily on the labs as they provide great visuals and review for the assignments/written exam. The programming exam/written exam can be stressful, but they are easy if you are prepared. Lectures/precepts are alright, but I didn't think precepts were particularly useful."
Lol don't be like me and not realize there's a textbook and then not read it until the night before the final written exam. Also professor Liao is awesome and great at explaining things :)
"Read the textbook and watch lectures! The lectures can basically substitute the first few topics, but once you get into more advanced topics, the textbook goes a lot more in-depth than the lectures. Precepts are especially helpful, so make sure you go to those."
"I?m new to coding and i would say that CS 101 honestly does too much. Which is from what i found out a shift from last semesters. You need to mentally prepare yourself to do CS every SINGLE day. There are labs every other day, lectures every other day, a precept once a week (that i only found out this week that is optional so take it as you will), readings if you still have the mental sanity and dedication to actually understand all the material, quizzes every other day (3x a week) including weekends, AND a programming assignment a week. So basically every single day needs to be dedicated to CS in some way if you want to do well.As for the assignments, I have pretty much enjoyed them. It?s a great way to apply the LOTS of knowledge that is all over the place that you have been trying to learn the past week. Gets easier to do once you know what they?re asking for.The exams are interesting ?? at least they were this year. They expected from us stuff way different from other years.I recommend going through the lab code if you have no clue on how to do something on your weekly assignment it usually helps.Go to lab even if you don't attend the lecture, the labs really help.If you are trying to debug your code don't spend hours trying to debug just go to lab tutorss. They can point out the problem in 5 minutes opposed to your 3 hours. Save your time. This is honestly a game changer"
"First:Learn some Java before you take the course!This by no means a requirement to do well, but it will be very, very helpful. This advice especially applies to those who have very little experience or no experience programming. The beginning of the course zooms through the basics of Java in the first few weeks before diving into more complicated topics. Establishing these fundamentals ahead of time will give you a head start, so you won't be overwhelmed by learning a new programming language.There are a ton of websites (like code academy) that have online tutorials. Personally, depending on how fast you work, I would suggest starting a tutorial a few weeks before the course starts.Second:READ!The book is a great resource. The readings for this course cover more central material than the lectures. In order to have a better grasp on what you will be tested on, DO THE READING! It also does a really good job of breaking down concepts and explaining them concisely. I usually used the lectures to review or reinforce the reading material."
Necessary course in my opinion for anyone in any department without Java experience -- the 'multidisciplinary' part of the name is not a joke.
"If you have an inkling that you'll enjoy computer science, this is a very good and engaging way to get into it. You may need to already have a liking for puzzles, but the course will mostly have your back in the way of help and walking you through individual assignments. I personally took this class with a 5-course load and found it to be one of the least demanding aspects of my schedule despite the fact that I am a humanities concentrator."
"If you are interested in cos and are willing to put in a lot of work (particularly if you have no previous experience) it is a good class, especially if you need to complete a QCR and are sick of math. The structure and organization is helpful even though it sometimes make the course feel very impersonal and rather industrialized so make sure to take advantage of office hours and the lab tas."
I would recommend the student to ask a lot of questions during labs and to try to participate as much as possible during precepts.
"Great class! If you've never programmed before, it can be a bit overwhelming, though. I went into the class with some coding experience and as a prospective CS major and definitely learned a lot, but also wasn't as overwhelmed as my peers who had no experience."
Take it!!!
I would learn some Java before the course so the programming assignments and exams are easier.
"This course will be hard for students with no prior coding knowledge, but was not as bad as I expected. Go to office hours and lab tutors sessions as often as necessary."
"As someone who isn't a CS major and had no experience coding prior to this class, I would still say that this is one of the best taught classes on campus. Highly recommend."
"Study for the written tests, go to labs, try to get weekly coding assignments finished as early as possible."
"As a humanities student, this course was very approachable. Start the assignments early; for someone with little coding experience, the assignments took longer, especially before N-Body. Fear the written exams. You will lose most of your points on those"
"Try the assignments by yourself first, before going to ask for help. Try to plan your code our instead of brute forcing it."
"It's a fun and necessary course. Try to go in with the attitude that you're learning new things, and understand that it's a lot of material to absorb in 12 weeks. The weekly assignments are quite generous, so take advantage of those, especially because they make up a lot of your grade. They're also a good way to study for Programming Exams. Written exams are pretty tough, so do the best you can with old exams and get through them."
Very well developed class. Provides a nice introduction to computer programming.
"Be careful on the final. The last final covered a lot of definitions and were worth over a third of the exam. You should be extremely careful when selecting definitions because a lot of the time, there's not a clear answer, just a ""best"" one. The programming exams are reasonable if you do the projects, but the written exams are what will hurt you in the end."
"Take more time to watch the lectures than you usually would, and go to lab and precepts"
Good class-- theory heavy end of the class wasn't my favorite but projects and assignments were cool. The course staff was very accommodating. If you've had some coding experience assignments are very reasonable. If you have no coding experience take w caution and w the option to p/f
"This is a great introductory computer science class, but it does move very quickly."
My advice is to use office hours. The one time I went to office hours was on my penultimate project and the preceptor saved me from so much additional time/frustration.
Take time to understand all codes
ed lessons are helpful
"Make sure to attend lectures and class to increase your understanding of the material. The coding feedback provided is extremely valuable, take it to heart. Additionally reading the textbook page by page is not needed to do well, however, it will really expand your curiosity for computer science."
This is a very well organized interesting introduction to Computer Science that covers many topics.
"Definitely one of the more fun distribution requirements! If you take advantage of lab tutorss and office hours, the assignments aren't that bad and are generally super cool/interesting - just don't leave them till the last minute."
This is a really well designed course! Make sure you pay attention when it comes to theory! Take advantage of your precept!
"This class is not too difficult if you have some programming experience, all though you can still do great with no experience. The projects are all very reasonable and fun to work on. Watch out for the programming exams if you aren't good under time pressure though!!"
Super fun course for anyone who likes or is interested in computer science!
"CS 101 is a great class!! If you have no prior programming experience, it is doable but it will take a lot of time and effort, so do not underestimate that. The amount of resources and guidance provided make it quite easy to gauge how you are doing in the class and see where you need to improve. You learn a lot in this class, so if you have any interest in computer science you should take it!"
"I really enjoyed this course! It's useful for any student, regardless of concentration, and the assignments are fun to complete. The course is fast-paced but manageable as someone who came into it with little prior computer science experience."
"A really well organized class & intro to CS. Definitely takes a lot of time, but the assignments are interesting & fun to do. All of the staff are great and THE LAB TUTORS SAVED MY LIFE. I came in with a good amount of CS experience from high school (including CS A) and this class reviewed all of that pretty quickly & then went beyond. Fast-paced (especially if you don't have previous CS experience), but doable."
"If you're thinking of taking CS 101, take it. It's a great class that gives you great exposure to CS concepts and Java programming. Programming clicks for some people and doesn't click for others?I didn't think assignments were too hard, but some people really had to work hard. Either way, I felt like I had really accomplished something by the end of the course."
Very fun and engaging class. Absolutely scientific design of course structure.
Make sure to keep up with the readings and lecture videos.
"I thought I could place out of this test with my knowledge from AP (scored 5) and my knowledge of Java, but this course turned out to be more than that so I still had to take it. For the first half (maybe more) of the course, I was bored. A lot of what we were learning was review for me. That being said, if I hadn't already had some background in the content, I could definitely see myself struggling, because this course moves fairly quickly. I found the ""labs"" and Compass101 quizzes (with answer explanations) to be really helpful, definitely participate in those."
"Make sure to stay caught up/read ahead on the textbook and lectures. Also complete all the quizzes and reviews to the best of your ability, its free practice and a good way to earn marks."
Make sure you understand all the labs and precept material before doing assignments.
"It was honestly pretty easy if you have a little coding background already. Even though the class quickly was teaching me things I did not know before, I had no trouble picking them up. This class was my easy class this semester but I still learned a ton."
"Lectures are very informative and sufficient for labs and assignments, but take the time to really read the text and engage with the Q&As and questions. It will save your life on exams."
Stay on top of the lectures and attend office hours!
"Take this course, and you will probably have a good time."
"Keep up with the assignments, they should not take long if you get started early and work carefully without rushing."
A great introduction to computer science. The beginning might be difficult if you don't have programming experience. The theoretical material near the end of the course is very interesting.
"Do not take this course if you do not have to. If you have some background in computer science, get your easy A. If you can p/f it, p/f it. It really is too much stress and not worth the workload."
"Make some time in your schedule each day to spend on CS 101 assignments. The hardest part of CS 101 is the amount of work that you have to do daily. However, if you keep up this work everyday, you will learn so much about computer science and programming and will have a sufficient understanding of each concept. The key to succeeding is just in the time you spend."
"As a person who was completely new to coding before this class, take it! It is a great course and gives good exposure to the basics of programming."
Find other people to study with.
"This is a great way to get a basic introduction to Computer Science. Even if you have already taken AP Computer Science, you will still learn a lot about theory."
"Be on top of topics, especially as they become more conceptual at the end of the term. The exams are more abstract that you may expect. Make the most out of labs, precepts, and the programming assignments."
Start your assignments early
"If you are coming in with some CS experience (I had 2-3 years during high school), this course will be fairly straightforward. I spent about 4 hours per week outside of class (labs and precepts) watching lectures and working on problem sets. If you are an engineering major, this course is required (unless you take the placement exam). Definitely a good course if you want to refresh your CS knowledge."
"Students considering to take this course should be sure to complete the labs and ensure they understand all material on the labs, as written exams often mirror the content from the labs."
"Get a good lab partner that you work well with and can explain things in a way you think. Overall really amazing class I learned a ton and I really don't think you need to come in with a lot of experience. Everyone is super helpful and go to the lab tas if you need help doing an assignment. I went through the class doing fairly well without reading the textbook, so maybe don't?"
This course is super well-organized and well-run. The assignments take a few hours but are relatively straightforward and easy to get full credit on. The tests are where your grade could take a hit.
"Use every resource that is provided to you! The textbook is a great supplement to the lectures if you need to clear up on anything. If they still provide Compass 101 resource guides, consider using them too (and reviewing the quizzes) because I kind of forgot they existed but wish I hadn't. Also, be proactive in asking for help -- don't fall behind like I did. The semester gets a bit harder as it goes along."
Pay attentions during the labs - they really help develop your understanding of the course material.
Great course. I would recommend doing the readings.
"Lots of work, but taking the class will provide a solid foundation for future coding endeavors."
Watch the lectures
"Take this course!! It requires some time commitment, especially if you are new at coding, but it is interesting and fun. One of the best-organized courses on campus."
"Learn quite a bit, can be hard if you don't stay on top of work"
good
"this course was probably my favorite of the ones I took this semester. Worked great virtually, and preceptors/tutorss are always there to help with assignments. Make sure to get a good partner for the later assignments, it really helps. Do ALL of the practice exams to study."
"Go to every laboratory sessions, and just keep doing practice problems. The only way to get better is to just code more."
"If you don't need this grade for anything, p/f it. The assignments are fun but time-consuming, and there's no point in learning the theory if you're never going to need it again. But you'll definitely learn a lot if you've never coded before, and there's A TON of support! Go to office hours and lab tutorss!!"
It shouldn't be too difficult as long as you attend all the labs and precepts
"The course is intense and demanding but definitely very rewarding and manageable. Be prepared for a steep learning curve (though the content isn't necessarily difficult to comprehend). The course is designed in such a way that you really come to master the course content (so long as you keep up with everything, that is), which makes the final exams very manageable. Skimming the readings is more than enough, doing the (lab) exercises, assignments, and past exams are far more useful to stay on top of everything. The theory exams really didn't ask for intricate details (whereas the book does have a tendency to be overly elaborate, so don't waste your time reading every detail)."
"This class is worth taking no matter what. It is some of the most fun I have had in any class or school setting. It never feels overwhelming or overly complicated, and the instructors give you a great deal of freedom in your work while also guiding you and even holding your hand at times when a topic is very new and complicated. 10/10 class that made me want to learn so much more about CS even though I do not plan on making it my major."
"This course is easily accessible to anyone, regardless of prior programming experience."
Learned a lot
"Whether for a distribution requirement or you are just interested, take CS101. I personally believe that everyone in the twenty-first century should be introduced to the skills taught in this course."
"I would advise the student to stay on top of the lectures, attend office hours, and make sure to attend and do all of the labs! They are super helpful."
Plan out your schedule for CS because there are so many components to the course and it can sometimes be hard to keep track of what to do when.
I would say definitely try to stay on top of everything and don't fall behind because programming is a skill that you obtain over time.
"Watch the lectures and do the labs. The textbook is helpful if you don't understand something from the lectures. Precept is helpful for tricky conceptual questions. When studying for exams, do the past exams and practice timing yourself to get used to the time constraints."
"Do not worry if you do not have a strong background in computer science. If you are looking to nice introduction to the field and enjoy solving practical problems through a logical lens, this course is perfect for you."
Please come prepared to put in the work and watch the videos as well as start the weekly assignment ahead of time.
"The campus clearly put a lot of thought into the organization of this course and the structure. It is helpful to have some basic knowledge of the fundamentals of coding before starting this course so you aren't completely lost. I found precept useless and attendance was optional, so if you understood the material, there is really no need to go. During the online learning, I felt some of the assignments were busy work (especially in the beginning of the course, such as labs) but eventually, the course heads listened to our comments and changed this, so overall I learned a ton and had a good time with this course, without it being a huge time commitment (5-7 hrs a week for me total)."
"This was definitely my favorite class this semester! If you have even the slightest interest in computer science, this course is a must. The programming assignments are fun and guidance through course material is very thorough. I had never coded before, and I was helped through every step of the way."
Don't skip the lecture videos and leave it to your lab partner to explain what's going on
"Practice a lot early on, and make sure you have the fundamentals down solid."
Do the labs carefully and ask your facilitator if you don't know anything. They are by far the most helpful thing in this course. Start your assignments early and go to office hours with Preceptors if you have a stubborn bug or don't know where to start.
"Programming in java is cumulative, so ask questions as needed"
"Great course, interesting professors and mind-boggling assignments!"
Just take it.
"As with anything, start assignments early and really try to fix any bugs before asking for instructor help--they answer quickly anyways and you'll learn much better from working through it yourself."
I'd say to attend lots of lab hours for help
"I would take the class if you're looking for a challenge, but it is difficult."
Very good course to start learning computer science. A lot of work still though.
"Be sure to go to lab tutors's, office hours, etc early on if you are having trouble because concepts build quickly."
Do the programming assignments early. Go to Lab tutorss if you need any help. Watch all of the lectures and pay attention to every small detail.
I took this class as a senior and did enjoy it. You have to put in a lot of work though.
"A great way to get exposure to real computer science. The first few weeks have a steep learning curve as you figure out how to figure out to code, but then you'll get in the groove. If you talk to tutorss and are willing to put in the time (for me, a new coder, it was around 6 hours per project), you should have no trouble getting close to perfect scores on the programming assignments, but the exams can be very rough (programming exams are timed and very difficult if you're new to coding, and the written exams aren't easy either), so it's not easy to get an A unless you devote your life to it or are already a decent programmer. If you're a STEM major, this class will teach you really important material, and if you're a humanities major it'll still be worthwhile, although I would recommend you p/f."
"This course is a good introduction to various facets of computer science, even if it moves a bit fast at times."
Put in the work and you'll be rewarded
"For students who are familiar with programming but may need to fill holes or learn Java specifically, this course is worth the time - the assignments are worthwhile and intellectually stimulating."
Attend all of the labs - they will make sure that you understand the course material.
"I strongly recommend this course, especially if you have the option to take this or a math class. There are weekly coding assignments, two written tests (one cheatsheet), two programming tests (open book), and a final coding assignment, which is just like a really long weekly assignment.You probably don't need to buy the textbook, although it is very helpful for the written exams and practice problems. If you choose not to, at least read the booksite in preparation for written tests. Pay attention to the lectures - you don't have to take extensive notes but definitely jot down big ideas. The coding assignments are really not as hard as you might hear (nbody is not that bad), especially if you fully read the assignment documents. Start them early in the week so that you can go to Lab tutorss if you need, but I never took more than 5 or 6 hours on them (on average, it took me ~3 hours each with no prior coding experience). You also don't need to have a partner for the partner assignments but it is definitely very nice."
"Take this class no matter how much you think you know coding. Especially with technology being where it is today, this course not only teaches some basics of Java, but also goes into some theory of computer science to help you understand how it all works. As long as you do the lectures and labs and go to class, you should have no problem with this class."
"I know students who breezed through this course because they had some coding experience, but for me it was honestly really challenging. I still think it was worth it, though."
"This class can be very time consuming but the assignments are fun. The tests, in comparison, are significantly more difficult, which is especially frustrating because they stray from the material necessary for the assignments"
I would advise them to look at the pdf review sheets that come with the Compass Quizzes.
Leave a lot of time for the assignments! They're genuinely fun if you allow yourself time to figure things out for yourself
"Read the assigned textbook chapters first and take notes, then watch through the lectures. It's okay to be a little confused, because you'll work through the concepts in the labs and precepts."
A very useful skill and understanding to have regardless of major. expect it to take a lot of time though
"It's very fun in the first half, but it gets really annoying after midterm season. Once we started moving away from actual Java programming and more into the technicalities of programming and theoretical computer science, things started to get messy. The instruction became quite unclear and the assignments were whack. You'll do pretty well in this course if you have previous programming experience, but be prepared to put in a lot of time and effort if you do not have that experience."
"Strongly recommend this class. Great way to introduce yourself to a widely applicable field of study. As long as you complete the assignments, your grade should be fine."
"If you have to take this or want to take more advanced CS classes, then you don't really have a choice. This course isn't extremely challenging, but also isn't terribly interesting (I mean, it's an intro CS course...)."
Prepare well for the written exams!
"Absolutely take this course! It is really interesting and the assignments are fun as well. If you enjoy logical thinking or mathematical thinking, or if you have good attention to detail, you will do especially well. Definitely expect to spent 10+ hours a week on it, though."
Take this course if you have any interest in Computer Science!
Very good structure and many resources if you ever feel lost.
"Take this course! Great intro to computer programming, take to get a strong foundation. Fun assignments!"
Have fun with the labs and assignments they are by far the most helpful and enjoyable.
Make sure to do all the labs; the course is very well defined so us that to your advantage in planning out the work
Take this course if you have a general interest in computer science! The course goes by pretty fast so I would recommend studying a little Java before you take the class if you are a beginner. Make sure to revise topics you've learned because you will need to be strong in them to do well on the written exams.
"Excellent course. Having some basic prior knowledge with Python and working with a terminal, this class was very good at teaching about the concepts of coding."
Understand the theory as well as the programming tools.
"CS101 is a whirlwind, and it will be a lot of work, especially if you don't have much CS background. It does a really good job of teaching you a lot of material in a very short time, though, and it has a ton of resources to help if you feel stuck."
"This course is really awesome if you have a little experience with computer science. Otherwise, it definitely moves fast in the beginning and will require a lot of time to understand concepts and get the basics down. Overall, fascinating projects and the labs are really helpful. The labs are more important than the lectures, if you can't watch the lectures just make sure you sign up for the labs. The precepts are kinda silly."
"I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to take a CS course, whether it's for a distribution requirement, certificate, or major. It's a very well-taught course, the material is made to be easily digestible, and the workload was bearable (although if you are new to coding, do know it will take a lot of extra effort to do the assignments)."
"They say this class is accessible to people who have never done computer science but that is not so. There are a lot of resources available, but if you come in not incredibly math/science inclined, and having never done coding, there is not much possibility you will excel in this course. That being said, coding is such a necessary skill it's worth it to p/f the course and actually learn a thing or two."
I had almost no coding experience and still found this class interesting and accessible. It's a lot of work but worth it.
"Very cool course. Your experience in the class varies based on the amount of coding experience you have prior taking it. Things can be rough if you have little experience. You'll just have to put in more work. Regardless, I'd recommend the class to anyone."
Feel free to reach out to friends that have already taken the class. Stay within the guidelines the Cos departments working with others rules.
"Stay on top of the HW and take advantage of tutorss and partnering! I would recommend reading the summaries on the book site and using the book itself for further elaboration when you need it. Attend labs and precepts, they help!"
"Take advantage of the resources and help, especially tutorss when you're stuck on an assignment."
"The psets were definitely manageable, but the written and programming exams were difficult. That being said, the course is cumulative so make sure to understand the material each week as you progress."
I would advise all students to take this course to improve their coding skills.
"This course is a very-fast paced but thorough introduction of computer science. As someone who didn't have coding experience, the class builds the foundational intuition needed for work in computer science. I did feel a bit disadvantaged compared to the CS majors/those who had experience, but I felt like this was unavoidable. The examinations are difficult, and the assignments took up to 5 hours a week. Lectures took up 2 hours, even though the allotted time was a lot less. However, the course materials were well-designed to facilitate learning. I would recommend this class for anyone interested in CS, regardless of previous experience in the field. However, it is important to note that having good problem-solving and analytical/quantitative thinking is needed especially for those without real CS experience. Moderately difficult class, but I learned a lot."
"If you are debating taking this course, you should take it. Everyone should have a basic understanding of comp sci and this course exposes you to some very important and compelling concepts. With that being said, if you're coming in with no prior comp sci experience (as I did) expect to spend A LOT of time on this course. Be prepared to work every single day and make sure you take the time and energy to absorb the lectures. If you don't understand something, read the book. Precepts are optional, but attending them is more than worth your time if you have a good preceptor because they are a great chance to address any leftover questions from the week. Don't let yourself fall behind--catching up will be extremely difficult."
Assignments aren't too hard if you took AP Comp Sci in high school. Programming exams are fair. Written exams are really tough. Reviewing labs will help. I did not need to read the textbook but heard it could be helpful. Didn't take more than a few hours a week for me. Good intro to coding and assignments were very fun.
"This course is great whether you are a CS major or not. All majors should take this course in my opinion, you learn a lot of helpful stuff and it isn't too difficult."
"I learned a lot about Java through this course, but it is fast paced. This is my first time coding, and the assignments took me 3-7 hours a week. None of the material was extremely difficult, but there will be things that you get confused on. Don't be afraid to ask your lab tutorss, classmates, or instructors for help! Coding is not an easy task! If you can, try to get Allison Chou as your lab! She was great and super helpful. Good mix of theory and actual coding. Recommend for all B.S. !"
"If you don't have any experience coding, I recommend learning the very basics of Java before getting started in the class, since coding would quickly become painful if your program keeps failing to compile due to small syntax errors (I learned this the hard way). Also Lab tutorss are more helpful (and efficient) than you would think, so if you can't debug your code it is a better use of your time to throw your ego out the window and ask for help."
It helps to start the projects early on.
"Do your work and don't miss lecture videos or assignment due dates. Course is a lot of work, but manageable if you don't procrastinate too much."
"If this is your first computer science class, the first few weeks will be the most confusing. The course sets the foundation extremely quickly, so you need to understand everything completely or else you'll definitely be lost afterward because the content builds on top of itself. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone new to computer science that feels truly passionate about learning it."
"Be sure to take labs seriously, you can learn a lot about them if you want to, especially if you kind of spaced out during lectures or reading the textbook. Precepts are a great time to ask questions, programming exams are pretty cool, and tests can sometimes be frustrating (content, grading) so don't be afraid to ask for regrades and make sure you can handle to time-crunch of programming exams."
"It can be challenging, but it is extremely interesting, unique, and fulfilling. You must advocate for yourself when you need help and reach out to resources when needed. People are ready and want to help you as much as they can. Some instructors have extremely fun and extroverted personalities, while others can be dry. This can make or break your experience if you do not already have a foundation or level of interest in the material. Nonetheless, I never had a bad experience with someone who was offering me advice and aid; it was always productive or enjoyable. Get to know people in the course so you can make good partnerships and study with others. Stay up to date and pace yourself. If you can hold yourself accountable to learning the material on time, you will be just fine."
"I think that every student in every department on campus could benefit from taking this course. While some material in the second half of the year does get a bit too theoretical for my liking, I cannot believe how much I learned in just one semester. Definitely prepare to spend about 10 hours a week on the class, especially if you are new to coding, but the knowledge you will leave the class with is astounding and more than worth it."
"It might be tough with no prior coding experience, but it is definitely a class worth taking. The material is very engaging and the projects feel more like fun puzzles to solve than actual assignments"
"This course it manageable if you do the work. To maximize your exam performance, you should definitely complete all the practice exams."
"The course is completely accessible to anyone with any level of programming experience and I would say the whole class is structured in such a way that you cannot really do poorly as long as you put in the time. Instructors are excellent, everything in the assignments is made very clear, and if you go to office hours I promise you will get the grade you want. Later topics were also incredibly interesting to me."
This course may be a bit fast paced if you do not have prior knowledge of programming.
"I would highly recommend taking this course if you are at all interested in programming. Although, be warned that it can require a decent time commitment if you have no experience with programming as it is a lot of material that moves quickly."
"As a QCR, this course gobbles a lot of time on weekly assignments, which are largely educational and masochistic exercises. If you might have a mild interest in learning to program, it's cool and certainly not a waste of time, but don't expect to love every second."
This is a great introductory course! I really enjoyed it.
"This is an excellent course to take, whether you've taken very basic computer science in the past and are looking to go further or are just starting out!"
"They completely overhauled the course from previous semesters, almost doubling the class load for not-that-much-better instruction. Hopefully they'll have fixed the new stuff by next semester; otherwise, good luck."
"I would definitely recommend this. I'm not CS but wanted to get a good intro, and this is definitely that."
moves fast if you don't have prior cs experience. But it's a really fun and cool course that I think a lot of people can enjoy
"A good intro to coding, and the concepts taught relatively well, but a little fast-paced."
"CS 101 is exactly what you expect it to be. The entire course is pretty much online, and so it worked well in the zoom format. If you have any prior experience coding, I think 226 is a better fit"
Take it! It's a fun course. Be prepared to work hard if you don't have a background in CS.
The Ed lessons are very helpful in understanding the material. Lab tutorss and office hours were essential when needing help on assignments.
Not an essential class for sure but still fairly interesting as a non-stem person.
"Great class! Try to get either August or Kaplan as a preceptor - Kaplan was wonderful. Def manageable if you don't have any coding experience. The labs and precepts sound like a lot, but the more time you put into the classes themselves, the less you'll need to do outside of class on the assignments/lab quizzes/etc."
Take the course but start assignments early so you can questions as needed
"My advice would be to be diligent about watching and comprehending the lecture videos and if you have very little coding experience, start the assignments early so that you can get help."
Take this course if you are even remotely interested in programming. Class was lots of fun and not too challenging. Make sure to watch lectures and read the textbook if you ever feel confused after lectures. Labs were possibly the most helpful part of the class so don't miss those.
"Highly recommend taking this class if you're even a bit interested in computer science. Of all my classes this semester, CS101 probably adjusted the best to the virtual environment. Having 2 labs and a precept every week was super helpful to ensure I understood the new content, and to make sure I didn't fall behind. I took AP CS A in high school and have some supplementary programming experience, but still learned a lot! The assignments are pretty fun and took an average of 2-3 hours to complete for my level of experience. The written exams can be tricky, but make sure you do lots of practice with past exams and you will be fine."
"it's good to understand CS, even if you're not majoring in it. this class is really helpful, though presents a learning curve for people with no coding experience (like me) However, everyone is really ready to help you through difficult parts of the course."
"Take this course if you have previous programming experience. The speed will not be what you expect from a beginner's class. If you are talking this course to satisfy a math requirement, consider an alternative."
