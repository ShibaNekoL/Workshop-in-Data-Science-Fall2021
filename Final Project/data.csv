I can pretty much get along with anyone, but I'm wondering if I can ever be in a relationship that is truly passionate. Project Evolove says I'm most attracted to those with my own instincts and those who are ENTP/ENFPs. So far I have dated an INTJ and an INFP (but I don't know what their instincts are). Any other INFJs out there want to share their experiences with ENTPs or ENFPs?"", 'Personally, I would rather be with my own kind (INFJ) than any other type. Yet, I always end up with INTJs (who I have a magnetic attraction with).', 'Love, depth, compatibility, understanding and safety.', ""Security, compassion, highly driven, good humor... I guess. That's what I'm looking for."", 'Honesty, loyalty, love, concern, intelligence, wise, strong , friendly, polite, humble, reasoble, moral, just, understanding, respectful, considerate, and artstic.', ""I'd love to date another INFJ, someone who who is passionate, driven, and likes to laugh."", ""Well, I would like someone who is relaxed, nonjudgmental, accepting, mentally and emotionally stable...ish. Someone who likes humor, who isn't afraid to have some experimenting of the passions, as de Sade would call them, among other things. Surprisingly, quite the high demand."", 'I would just like someone to talk to. I think there is much more depth to a relationship than what is on the outside. INFJs know that to have a lasting relationship, you need to be with someone who will communicate with you verbally and emotionally.\n\nMy partner would also be my best friend. All my loyalty and passion would be focused on this one individual and they have to understand that. Because once a NF sees someone they like and they open up to them, we becomely fiercely loyal to a fault.\n\nI think people who do not like clingy men/touchy feely men tend to shy from that. Which is why so many of us are misunderstood. Shame really.', 'I have been with an ENTP for a short time and can say it was great although short.

I really do think they are wonderful and I'm drawn to their ability to make me feel more alive. But I'm also skeptical of these two because I'm unsure whether I am capable of keeping up with them since I'm so shy. I believe after a while they may become irritated with being the one to handle social situations.

It's just that they might not want to talk about or participate in the things I identify with as much. They wouldn't mind talking about it per-say, but I imagine they wouldn't really want to work towards those goals along with me. Which is okay! As long as we have an intense one-on-one relationship that's fine."", 'Was interested to see that my type is typical of Sexual-socials. My occupation was also mentioned. I would prefer to date a Sexual- social or Social-sexual. I also crave that INTENSE and DEEP 1 on 1 connection.', ""Neither PEVO nor Heidi Priebe lists Sexual/Social (Sx/So) as a common Instinct among INTPs ??a point with which I differ. I suspect that Instinct is misreported nearly as often as Type.\n\nSexual/Socials ?œchannel their sexual energy and aggression into intimate, one-on-one relationships or into heartfelt political, artistic, or scientific causes.??I think we eventually discover that the people to whom we are most intensely attracted are not our ideal partners for all situations. That's probably a good thing. It forces us to branch out.\n\n?œHeartfelt causes??makes Sx/So a strong preference. I am reminded, though, of Joan Baez's song about her relationship with Bob Dylan, in which she writes ?œA savior's a nuisance to live with at home.?\n\nAt home, some Sx/So's will seek out the balancing influence of a Secure Primary or Secure Secondary. Out-and-about, a Social Primary can force us to get out of our own heads and interact with other humans in a more casual way. These pairings come with their own tensions, though. Each partner is being pulled way outside their comfort zone and is likely to have friends and associates with whom they can share other interests, sometimes intensely. Earning one another's trust and respect is absolutely essential.\n\nSecure/Sexual (Sp/Sx) is probably my second preference. This is not one of the three that PEVO suggests are most common for us. PEVO lists INFPs among Sp/Sx's, as does Heidi Priebe (though perhaps only 22% of INFPs. For all I know, they use the same source. For all I know, they are the same person.) INFPs may appeal to me for some of the same reasons as Sp/Sx.\n\nSo is Instinct or Type the main attraction? I think a strong case can be made that Instinct is a better indicator of similar social motivation, while Type is a better indicator of similar communication styles. Similarity is not the same as attraction. Similarity is not the same as compatibility."", 'Per Project Evolove\'s description, I\'d be sx/so.\nPer ""The Complete Enneagram"", I\'d be enneagram 7 with so/sx instinct.\nMy happiest relationship was with an ESFP 729 sx/so.\n']","['Sexual-Socials', 'Instincts']",Sexual-Socials

I have a lovely ENTP friend who likes to organize group activities in the city, and whenever I eventually accept the invitation, it is painful for me.

It is really hard to have decent deep conversation with anyone that doesn't know you already or isn't a close friend yet. Most people only want to have ''fun'' and look for sensation and excitement.\n\nI can't stand it if someone does not let me finish my thoughts or stories, so I rather be quiet than to accomodate to what others like to hear or talk about all the time.

Yet our outward expression is... lacking."", 'I have no idea.\n\nHowever, I hear some INFJs can be actors.\n\nI have an ISFP friend who wants to be a performer\n', ""I cannot say which persona type makes the best actor.\nBut I might make certain assertions or suggestions.\n\nHmm.\n\nI consider that N types may have an easier time grasping the thoughts/feelings/emotions within a character that they are portraying.\nI consider this natural tendency may only be rivaled by an S type that has experienced\nALOT of things or something specific for the role he or she is playing. (Consider that what they reveal on stage will likely be their own personal response to some event in their own life that created similar emotions- since S's rely on their past experience).\n\nHowever, you said actor/performer. That's pretty broad because you can perform in dance, and act in a movie- and the two are very different. Body movement is different than mimicking facial tones, cues, and drawing from inner emotions to mirror them- even if they may incorporate similar elements.\n\nI equate that to the difference between a sorcerer and a wizard.\nSorcerers learn magic naturally and can cast spells more often.\nWizards learn spells through intense study, and know more spells, though they cast them less often.\n\nso perhaps that is our answer here- some types learn/experience more emotions and become better actors through such experiences.

I will warn you now this gets pretty bad!\n\nI am a simple traveler who ends up taking a wrong turn down an old forgotten path, night falls as I become completely lost in a dense forest. Attempting to backtrack my footsteps I find myself deeper in a land unknown, the sound of rustling of leaves above me, maybe it\'s just a small animal I pondered to myself. Unable to go any further I searched for a place to get better view of a crude, crumpled map in my hands, no luck as the area I seem to have entered does not appear on it.\n\nI studied the map intently on finding a way back suddenly a hand spread open appears to my left shaking as it caught my eye I turned around to get a better look. To my surprise a sharp blow struck the back of my head my body grew limp and I hit the ground with a thud. As I curled in a fetal position clutching the back of my head from the pain a figure stood before me, I peered upwards to see a woman standing over me with a blunt object in one hand and a rope in the other.\n\nShe yells at me in a foreign language I could not understand, she yells again this time with a kick to my stomach. As I grudgingly sat up the rope soon found its way around my neck and the blunt object struck me a second time as she fiercely yells at me some more, I struggled but eventually stood up. She eyes me carefully slowly examining me from top to bottom and muttering something that sounded like approval, her hand firmly around my neck she moves my head to the left and to the right then pointed in a direction and barked an order, I assumed she wanted me to walk...\n\nThe Game - You have been captured by an Amazon Warrior, at first she just wanted to use you as slave labor, but has made a snap decision to make use of you in another way. She strips you naked and have you kneel before her with a rope tied around your neck leading to one hand and a short whip in the other hand.\n\nThe Rules - She will command you to do an ""Action"" followed by a ""Body Part"" while speaking to you in a foreign language. It follows a 3-point system, you get 1 point if you do the correct action, 1 point if you do the correct body part, and 1 point if it pleases her. Failure in any of of these results in a whipping for each word you missed or if you did not please her with what you did. She may use a positive sounding word to express success or a negative NO sounding word to express disappointment; however, you still receive whips for failed points even if followed by a Success sound. The game ends when you have received a total of 10 whips and the score is tallied. It should be based on an Honor system, while you can make up the language as you go along, it helps that when you play this game that use the same words each time representing the ""Action"" the ""Body Part"" and the follow up responses.\n\nThe Outcome - If you did well in your endeavor she submits to you and allows you to do whatever you please with her. If you did fair, but not great then she gives you two options of how to further please her in hopes to redeem yourself.\n\n\n\n-- WARNING -- The last part gets freaky, ignore or cover this part if you don\'t want to read it! -- WARNING --\n\nIf you did poorly, you go into the shower/tub with a rubber knife and... Let\'s make this clean as possible, you\'re sitting down, she\'s standing up, your mouth meets her other ""lips"" until she is pleased. She then gives you a shower from said other ""lips"" followed up by the fake slitting of your throat with the rubber knife, and finally you both wash up and discuss what you did wrong without revealing the game, drop hints but don\'t give him the answers.\n\nEnjoy!', ""Well, I'm not sure how much detail I want to go into this, as my fantasies are highly private, and I never share them with anyone, ever. So I'll give a basic overview.\n\nI imagine myself being able to teleport to fictional worlds, like those out of video games or TV shows, where I fight enemies, save the world, and find my soulmate throughout. In many ways, my fantasies are like fanfiction, involving characters out of different games and shows, but with the plot and adventures significantly different. I am the protagonist in my stories, and face all sorts of challenges, from having my own world attacked, to acting as a spy and even a double-agent in order to take down my enemies that threaten my world, as well as the fictional worlds and the lives of my fictional friends. Not only do I have all sorts of adventures, but I fall in love and develop deep, loving, intimate relationships with the character of my choice (either fictional, or a real person whom I placed in my fantasies--my current is a certain famous actor whose name I won't mention).\n\nI know that probably sounds cheesy, but I really love my fantasies, and if I could find a way to turn them into books or fanfiction, I would do so. The main reason I haven't is because I find it hard to take what's going on in my mind and translating it into writing that other people can read and understand. Not to mention my fantasies tend to skip around a lot, and vary drastically in plots and characters, depending on what I choose to imagine, and it's hard for me to imagine taking them and writing them into a coherent, linear format that wouldn't be confusing. Plus, since I like to imagine several different plots and stories, I can't imagine picking just one plot and sticking with it until the very end, the way most stories are formatted.\n\nSo, uh...Probably not the sexual fantasy you were expecting me to describe, but I guarantee you, many of my fantasies are highly sexual, in addition to romantic.

I dated a foreign girl once, with a significant language barrier. She was very smart, and looked stunning... due to that language barrier though, I had to teach her much about English language and American culture. I loved it, and it seemed easy and natural for me! Though there may be plenty of topics I am oblivious to, I do not like to feel stupid in front of a woman. It is unbearable.', ""I think that both are important but overpowering evolutionary biology drives my sexual-social instincts. So, while passing on 'smart' genes to my offspring makes logical sense and something that I'd definitely want from a mate, like any other red blooded male out there, looks and not intelligence are always the final deciding factor - because the motivation hardwired into men's genes is to mate with attractive women so that their offspring may look more attractive and thus, in turn beget more progeny. It's weird how this works but supposedly, while good looks make women more likely to sleep with a man, a man who is more likely to come across as a 'provider' is the one that women are hardwired to want to marry. That's because that kind of man is more likely to 'provide' for her and her children when resources are scarce.

Being a girl with higher intellect, I want my desires to be where my logic is, and I would love to say intellect over attractiveness. But experientially, this doesnt always work, and in my in my inner core, this has always been a struggle. I have concluded for myself, that they have to have both, no exceptions.\n\nIf I could only choose one for some pervasive reason, logic would definitely override, and intellect would come first. Intellect for me would/could make one more attractive, while the one who is very attractive, can easily become less attractive and even despised with stupidity, or even just in the case where I am smarter. I would inevitably view them as weak and it would pervade my mind until I no longer viewed them as attractive, but loathsome.

Intelligence w/ looks. Have dated some of those genius types (one happened to be good looking too) and hard to tell where the line is between genius and crazy..lol. Plus, what's a romantic relationship if there's no physical chemistry--boring.\n"", ""The question is a hard one to answer. One can date anyone, but to be dating with someone suggests that there is a romantic interest involved. A romantic interest only surface if there is a physical chemistry going. Physical chemistry in turn is often the result of different triggers, most of which we are not even aware of, but alas they direct our behavior with an efficiency that has been honed through millions upon millions of years through natural selection to give the future offspring an edge.\nOf course one can create ones own principles and values, for instance that intellect is an important quality in a partner, and try to act upon that. However, the triggers for ones physical chemistry can too easily sucker punch us without us knowing it, creating a bias and post hoc rationalizations that ones date is actually smart and intelligent. Consequently this would in turn please ones principles and values even though the date, under other circumstances, would not pass ones principles and values of intellect being an important quality in a partner.\n\nHowever if one values intellect in a partner and the date is just so far away from having any kind of resemblance to an intellectual conversation then I'd say that would put a huge dent in the chemistry. But as long as the qualities one value in a partner are within an, somewhat, acceptable range, and the date carries the correct physical triggers for you, then the probability of being sucker punched increases :)\n\nThe scenarios that I have drawn up here represents dating a good looking person with an average intelligence. However with that being said, I am quite sure that preferences, values and principles of how a person ought to be, can, if fulfilled by someone, bring the butterflies too. For instance average looking, but so charming with his or her intellect that that one just keep on dating that person.\n\nI would rather date someone who is average looking but intelligent, but yeah.... :)"", 'http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201012/beautiful-people-really-are-more-intelligent', ""Personally, I would rather date someone that is average looking but intelligent. While it might seem strange, I'm rarely attracted to a man prior to having spoken to him. Typically if I find his looks decent, and he can carry on a decent conversation, I find myself much more attracted to him. While I think it's important to have that physical chemistry, a lot of times that comes later for me."", 'Sadly, physical ""beauty"" often fades over time. Intelligence, on the other hand, can grow over time. Build your relationship on mental stimulation and you can be stimulated for a long time. But its important to acknowledge--and enjoy--the physical chemistry that exists between two people. Fortunately, I have not found the two concepts to be mutually exclusive. :-) If you\'re an NT and you\'re being true to who you are, I think you\'ll try to find a good balance in the ""intelligence vs. attractiveness"" consideration.', ""I'd prefer average intelligence with good looks.\nI don't really care for intellectual conversations, they can be exhausting.

There might be a lot to talk about, but maybe we can focus on figuring out what Instinct and Personality type worked for you the best.\n\nI can begin. I dated a Social-Secure ISFJ on and off for 2 years. The best way I can describe it was that it as a stable relationship (while we were dating) that just never ignited. She was a sweet and genuinely good person, but I just could never get her to fully open up. It was like I kept digging, but realized that I couldn't dig any deeper. We had 3-4 breaks during those years, and each time it was initiated by me. Each time was really hard on me and I thought each was the last, but that obviously did not turn out to be the case. Although she would be sad with the breakups, she would never be upset at me and she would never do anything to prevent it. It was as if she knew that I would come back to her each time.

30,52,Let's get this started...,"['Anyone want to analyze my current relationship for me?\n\nSo I have been dating this girl for the past year, but because we are both so busy, i end up hanging out with her only once every 2-3 weeks. (by the way, in case your judging, she\'s not my official girlfriend, we are just seeing each other, and that\'s why I\'m free to be on here). She\'s not just cute, she\'s hot. Why in the world she is dating me, I have no clue. I think she is a Sexual-Secure ENFJ, though I need to spend some more time learning this psychology. Needless to say, we are extremely passionate about each other and the ""lovemaking"" is great.\n\nThe only issue is that she, like me, likes to be in control. For example, when we go somewhere, she\'s always half a step ahead of me, as if dragging me somewhere. She always telling me how I should be or how I should change something about myself. It is not that she\'s nagging, I think she\'s just naturally used to telling people what to do. Around her, I never feel like I am at 100% confidence, I always feel a little inadequate. It doesn\'t make me feel bad perse, it just annoys me that she keeps doing this. We talk about it, and she keeps saying that my ego is too big and she\'s just deflating me.\n\nDespite the passion and physical aspects being there, I can\'t decide if she is someone I can be with. I have been with an INFP before and I felt like superman. It was great, but the sex wasn\'t quite as passionate. Anyway, anyone other INTJ\'s dating another J (especially extraverted J) type? Ultimately, how does the dominance vs dominance conflict play out?', 'If she is not understanding or acknowledging what you are expressing, perhaps try other means of explanation (safe means of course)... Otherwise, she may just be too much to handle in that sense.', 'Tell her to tone it down and instead of telling you how you should be and so on, ask her to instead use the general format of asking you ""Why are you like ___, here is what I think/how I feel about ___; what are your thoughts?"" Engaging in an equal, back-and-forth, non-assuming dialogue is far more constructive than ""ego deflation"" via commands (even though they may be said nicely). It may take some work for her to be able to do that regularly but it can be done; if she isn\'t willing to at least try, then maybe you should look elsewhere.', ""Lol, that all sounds amazingly familiar- thank you AlexTech.\n\nI would say 'balance is key'.\nAnd the way that you might balance depends on where you'd want to go.\nUnderstanding how INTJ's can be (if I may generalize my personal info a bit), every two to 3 weeks is a good pace to develop something consistent over a long period of time.\n\n(Read: If she can keep up the 2-3 week think for a long time then she has good endurance and you should consider figuring out what her long term relationship goals are, and if they could fit in sync with your own).\n\nControl: That's the primary element that needs balance. Introverted or not, you are no one's subservient dog. Don't blow it up into a fight, but be confident in yourself and considerate to her when explaining why you are declining or disagreeing with her assertions. INTJ's role is as a mastermind or field marshal. This is a position that has value in a structure influencing others. I would suggest that such a valuable position needs a powerful partner with a strong, capable personality, but you have to be equally capable to handle yourself when interacting with such a person. Neither of you need to 'submit' indefinitely, but both of you need to have a degree of flexibility. But that's just natural in nearly any relationship.\n\nIf you guys last for a while, you will either naturally become more flexible regarding each other (even if it takes a while) or you will slowly drift apart and re-evaluate things (do we want to be together? Or do I want to embark on a different experiment?)\n\nThe end result comes down to your personal needs, however.\nYou are an INTJ.\nYou are also sexual secure (I would have selected that if the description for sexual-social wasn't so enticing, lol)\n\nBoth sex and security are important to you, and for an INTJ they tend to require a respectable, intelligent and independent partner as well. If she can provide you with these things, and you can provide her with what she needs then it may all just come down to balance. You guys aren't intended to rule each other, but to compromise with each other in order to produce the best possible union that your relationship can create.

48,81,ENTJs bored at their job,"[""I currently love my job cuz I am relatively new here and learning new things everyday. The problem is that I work at a government company, which means people get promoted slowly but surely. I don't mind learning the ropes for two years or so, but there's no way I can stick this out for a lifetime. I'm an ENTJ...I need to be working from the top. At the same time, it is hard leaving a company that pays decently and is so stable.\n\nI was wondering from my fellow ENTJs, have any of you found yourself fully engaged in the science/technical aspects of your work, rather than the leadership aspect? I know we usually fight for the leadership/management roles, but does that aggression and ambition settle down after a few years?"", 'Never.', 'Yes. I worked as an office manager for a small doctors office (3 physicians and 8 employees) for a few years. I succeeded in implementing paperless records for the practice, and helped the doctors who have no interest in the ""business"" side of healthcare become more profitable. But I quickly got bored dealing mostly with inter-office quarrels and endlessly tiring phone calls to insurance companies over pre-authorizations and payment reimbursement conflicts.\nI gave 2 weeks notice but ended up staying about 2 months to ensure the person they hired in my place was competent enough to do the job.',

I think they are just exceedingly rare. Also, it took him a while to admit he was INTP, while it was obvious to me from the start. Thus, it is possible that some INTPs who have a Social Instinct might have mistyped their MBTI. In addition, it is possible that the INTP MBTI descriptions are biased towards selectively describing those who have a weakest Social Instinct.', ""I can't see how it would be possible. The INTP architype is about as antisocial as it is possible to be.\n"", ""I think it's more that INTP's are averse to the word social and would probably not select themselves as such even if it were true. The INTP's inferior function is FE after all, and FE is a highly social cognitive function. For instance, I think most INTP's are irrated by social norms so much because the see how emotions and herd mentality can lead to negative consequences for our species. They're antisocial for social reasons. If it weren't so, INTP's wouldn't have a problem gaming the social mechanisms they see for their own benifit.""]","['Rationals', 'INTP - Architect', 'Personality']",INTP - Architect

51,84,Favorite MBTI type?,"['For all the INFJs out there, which Myers Briggs type do you think you are most compatible with and why?\n\nI personalty really like ENTPs. They always keep things fun, but they need me to reel them in :D', ""A few of my closest friends (both girls and guys) are INTJs, but I don't think I can date them. I agree with you on the ENTPs, they are smart and always a breath of fresh air. There are a few that I've noticed, but I never got them to pay attention to me yet...sigh."", ""From a friendship level: INTJs. I always click fastest with INTJs. Two of my best friends are INTJs. I've dated a couple and never found my emotional needs met.\n\nRomantically: I've never dated an ENTP but I've been drawn to them. There's also this ENTJ I've been smitten with. I'm very attracted to NTs in general.\n\nENFPs are supposed to be romantically compatible with INFJs as well. I've flirted with two and both became super flakey and nothing came of it."", ""I was in a long term relationship with an INTJ before, INFJs have deep thoughts and interesting insights that compel the INTJ's intellect and vice-versa. There's more of course that's positive, but the biggest problem is the INTJ not understanding feelings and whatnot that are crucial for INFJs. An INFJ wants to know the deeper meanings, but there is no deeper meanings when it comes to an INTJ after they open up to you -they are straightforward and rational not abstract.\n\nI have also been in a relationship with an INFP and that was magical. They 'get' an INFJs feelings for their ideals. And are in tune with the INFJs internal conflicts and are eager to support. The problem for us in that relationship was....well two artists types with different wants in life, plus an INFP might feel really hurt when the INFJ has a secluded spell...and an INFP isn't a natural leader or pusher for the INFJ. while an INFJ can lead and be strong in a relationship, this can be draining.\n\nI personally think that both types can still work out for an INFJ in the right circumstances and maturity levels :)\n\nI haven't experienced any other real relationships, I would like to meet an ENFP or an ENTP....or maybe even another INFJ. Haha."", ""I enjoy infps and other infjs. For most of the reasons that have already been listed by other.\n\nI have tried to date an enfp but the way we thought and our general needs were far too polar for it to ever amount to much more than a bumpy friendship.\n\nI am most interested in the Intp's they counter me and offer new out puts. So i continually grow and gain different perspectives. It is truly my favorite type for a friendship. I hope I will get to be in a relationship with one some day."", 'Also I would like to note that all of our usernames hint at a deeper meaning. XD', ""Oh man I have so many favorites. I love this stuff.\n\nISFPs: I frequently fall in love with ISFPs, but I don't think I could be in a romantic relationship with one. I absolutely adore the ISFP's mind and personality. A lot of my celebrity crushes have been ISFPs :3\n\nESTPs: My guilty pleasure is ESTPs. I love the wild devil-may-care attitude. It comes off as very powerful. I find them very mysterious and hard to figure out, compared to other types. They seem like just a big bag of conflict. I love writing ESTP characters in my stories :)\n\nENTPs: I know they're the ideal match and all, but I'm hesitant. I can safely say I've known two ENTPs personally in my life and they're incredible. Very much on my wavelength, and skilled at the verbal sparring I love so much. The first ENTP was very intimidating and not that good with his Feeling function, which was a barrier. The second ENTP is equally bad with his Feeling function and is also very introverted for an extrovert, so I find myself taking the lead a lot. I just don't know enough ENTPs, and I haven't done enough research on their type. I think they're something truly special to INFJs. I saw my ENTP coming a mile away :)"", ""My three loves were INTJ, ENFJ and INTP. I also have a good friend that's ENFP an another that's INFJ. I had a brief dating experience with an INFP as well. I have to say the best relationship was with an INTP (based on my own personal experience only). All things being equal, an INTP just made me feel very peaceful, secure and appreciated for who I am. The honesty and addictive deep conversations were soul-satisfying:) Only met one ENTP but I have to say I wasn't taken with him?? Outside of MBTI, I believe the key to finding that chemistry/spark has to do with being on a similar plane of individuation/actualization/differentiation. That's where the magic happens cuz you intuitively know we'll challenge each other in ways that will propel individual and relational growth. That's what I'm after:)"", 'You ladies are. INFJs are a bundle of wonderful.', 'i hate you all.\ni came into this thread thinking that i\'d leave feeling really good, and you\'re all like, ""supposedly ENFP, but...""\nno, but really, INFJ is my favorite, jerks.', ""I have clicked best with INFPs and INTJs in the past, but I don't know if I've ever been romantically involved with an ENFP or ENTP before so I'm not sure what it would be like."", ""I've got a few male INTJ friends and one female INTJ. All amazing people. We share the lead introverted intuition. My first love is an INFP. There was a connection there that I have not yet found again. But I haven't met many other female NFs. I have a male ENFP friend as well. Another amazing person. N types will always seem to communicate well with each other. We all love ideas and creativity and tend to be future oriented and value driven.\n\nI don't do as well with sensors because they don't seem to understand the need for depth of connection. They seem to go through the motions and say the words but are incapable of living those words. I may be wrong though. Take this with a grain of salt. I'm just coming out of a very lonely 12 year relationship with an S type.\n\nSomeone said opposites attract, but they don't stay together.\n\nI'm hoping to meet and talk to some NFs here."", 'q', '', '', ""ENFP sound like the perfect match for me.

She literally only dated one guy her entire life, and it was only for 3 months. For the last year, she has been heartbroken dwelling on him. She still says that she thinks he was right for her, but things just didn't work out. I'm listening to her talk about that guy, and I'm just thinking he is the most irresponsible, haphazard person out there (maybe like an ESTP or something, no offense).\n\nAnyway, in theory, INFPs should be the most vulnerable, being introverts and all, and having the primary internal Feelings function.

What do you all think?"", ""I don't think this is type-related.\n\nI think she's really insecure in herself, and bases a lot of her security in her relationships with others.

If they are exluded from that thy will get deeply depressed, fast.\nSocial introverts flourish in less crowded environments and will get drained when forced into a crowded environment.\n\nI consider social introversion/extroversion to be something that changes over time tho.\n\nCognitive extroverts (like ENFPs and ENFJs) are dependent on external information and consider it more important than the own subjective view. Thus it effect us strongly how pepple treat us.\nCognitive introverts (like you INFPs and INFJs) are more independent from external information and see subjective views as more important than the objective.\n\nThis is what Jung said about cognitive extroversion\n\nNow, when the orientation to the object and to objective facts is so predominant that the most frequent and essential decisions and actions are determined, not by subjective values but by objective relations, one speaks of an extraverted attitude. When this is habitual, one speaks of an extraverted type. If a man so thinks, feels, and acts, in a word so lives, as to correspond directly with objective conditions and their claims, whether in a good sense or ill, he is extraverted. His life makes it perfectly clear that it is the objective rather than the subjective value which plays the greater role as the determining factor of his consciousness. He naturally has subjective values, but their determining power has less importance than the external objective conditions. Never, therefore, does he expect to find any absolute factors in his own inner life, since the only ones he knows are outside himself. Epimetheus-like, his inner life succumbs to the external necessity, not of course without a struggle; which, however, always ends in favour of the objective determinant. His entire consciousness looks outwards to the world, because the important and decisive determination always comes to him from without. But it comes to him from without, only because that is where he expects it.\n\nJust to clarify my opinion, I believe that EJs and EPs are a lot more sensitive than IPs and IJs.\nBut it variates from case to case.', ""Acerbusvenator, that is deep.

Ram Dass brought focus in his speaking on awareness to the truth that these imbalances are separate from the quintessential humanity of all people.

58,92,Project Evolove's Population Breakdown: Instinct vs. MBTI,"['I was curious how instincts and MTBI interacted. The attached image shows where the current population lies. Enjoy.', 'Nice ;)\nThe types seem to be quite balanced. The large difference is in the instincts.', ""Thanks.\n\nI don't know much about MBTI and this is the first time I've come across instincts so I have no idea what any of this means. Still, I found a few things interesting about how the numbers were spread out.\n\nFirst off, our romantics and rationals are well represented but compared to general population, we're still missing a lot of our guardians and creators. Like Fuzzyslug mentioned in the original population breakdown: INFJ: [9.39% currently] -lolwut? (Thanks for the inspiration!)\n\nYa, the numbers on the instincts do have a decent spread. There's a lot going on there. Some types (ISTP, ESFJ) have a really strong preference toward a single instinct. Other types (INTJ, INFJ) have significant populations in multiple instincts. It would be nice to know more about instincts and why that variation exists.\n\nSome instincts are more popular than others. Most types have strong numbers in Secure/Sexual. Sexual/Secure is another favorite. Secure/Social and Social/Secure have only a few types that favor them, their numbers will likely stay low compared to the others. I think the numbers will even out a little more for them when we get more guardians and creators. That is to say I think the % for Secure/Social and Social/Secure will climb a bit more. Speaking of climbing, the Secure/Sexuals seem poised to clear 30% of the population, could reach a third or more.

59,93,Who are you looking for?,"['I thought it would be interesting to take a look at what our searches amount to.\n\nBeing a Sexual/Social, I naturally have my search set to Sexual/Social, Sexual/Secure and Social/Sexual. That part is rather straight forward... I guess I\'m more curious about what your MBTI preferences are.\n\nMy natural partners seem to be ENFP and ENTP. -Check. I\'m a romantic at heart and previous experience tells me INFJs and I get along rather well. Ya, I\'m the least emotional of all types and INFJ would be the most emotional of all types but once I get close, the relationship is very rewarding for us both. INFJ -check.\n\nI also have checks on ENFJ and INFP. I figure they\'re not too divergent from what would suit me best. Besides, their titile: ""Romantics"" appeals to me.\n\nFinally, INTJ. They are captivating creatures. I don\'t believe I\'ve ever dated one but many of their traits appeal to me. I would certainly give it a try.\n\nHow about you? What are you looking for?', ""Hm...\nI seem to be drawn to IFPs in general. It's a bit bitter-sweet tho and I seem to get along best with FJs and they are a bit more comfortable for me. Ironically tho, I know a female INFJ, but I'm not drawn to her because she quite automatically get seen by me as a sister or something. I guess I feel a need to protect her since she likes me, but anyways.\nSeems like I generally like the passion for what they believe in that attracts me.\nENFPs are kinda cool as well because they are so fluffy.\n\nDon't think I'm especially picky about the instincts however."", 'Ha - I don\'t know how to react to the assertion that ENFPs are ""fluffy.""

It does depend on those I meet and I don't want to limit myself though."", ""I tend to be attracted to extraverts - some of my favourite people ever are ENFPs. I suppose my ideal guy would be passionate, assertive, and more of a pursuer. I need someone who's willing to be direct and upfront about where they stand, and isn't afraid to be brutally honest with me whenever they have an issue."", ""I always seem to be attracted to mature INTJs. Even my best friend is an INTJ. Most people will tell you that ISFJs and INTJs don't get along. For the most part that is true because they typically cannot find a common language with which to communicate.\n\nI grew up in a small family of 5 and 2 of the members of that household are INTJ so I have been dealing with INTJs a long time. At any rate because we are so cognitively different, INTJs have the ability to show me different perspectives on things even when we share a common conclusion on some matter, and vice versa.\n\nThe emotionally mature INTJ (usually means mature Fi) is not as robotic or uncaring as people think. They are quite capable of being supportive. Just ask my bestie! Best thing since slice bread!"", 'NFs and NTs.', 'I would like to have an intellectual conversation with an ENFP.

I like discussing a wide variety of topics, but my personality and current situation don't lend particularly well to finding open-minded, curious individuals.\n\nIn terms of relationships, planting the deep-rooting seed."", 'Someone of similar interests - because fuck they are hard to find!', 'Agreed with Valentin. Question though. Do sexual socials and social sexual not care to ""settle down?""\n\nI mean, if you lack a ""secure"" instinct, then what would feed your need to have a monogamous relationship? Just curious.', ""Hmm, hard to say. Most of the close friends I have are NFs, and while I tend to click very well with other NFs, I find myself more romantically attracted often to NTs. There's just something really sexy about them, something I can't really put my finger on. I'd like to say intelligence, but almost all of the NFs I know are intelligent, too. Maybe they're a bit more of a challenge for me to get to know, and the challenge and mystery (for a lack of a better word) makes them all the more attractive to me."", '', '', '', '', ""It's difficult to nail down exactly what one is looking for, I think. For me; probably an ENTJ. I think it's a type that complements my own weaknesses well; providing the drive and ambition I otherwise lack.\nThough I do have a soft spot for ESFPs, I don't think I could have a lasting relationship with one. The spontaneity thrills and delights me, but also completely exhausts me.\n\nAlso, to answer badgirliam's question; I personally have a strong desire to settle down, and I think it's actually rooted in the lack of a 'secure' instinct. I've come to understand how desperately I lack stability in my life, and that's one of the main things I look after in a partner. Though to be fair it wouldn't have to be monogamous; while sex is an incredibly important part of any relationship, I also don't feel that it has to be... language barrier coming into effect here.. exclusive?"", ""I'm looking for a friend, not a romantic relationship.

They take things as they are and thus may be very good at easing a tense situation and pulling conflicting\nfactions together.\n\nThey are actively curious about objects, scenery, activities, food, people, or anything new presented to their senses.

Because they are not necessarily bound by a need to follow standard procedures or preferred methods, they are often able to see ways of achieving a goal by ?œusing??the existing rules, systems, or circumstances in new ways, rather than allowing\nthem to be roadblocks.\n\nThey make their decisions by using the logical analysis of thinking rather than the more personal values of feeling. Their thinking enables them to crack down when the situation calls for toughness, and also helps them grasp underlying principles.They learn more from first-hand experience than from study or reading, and are more effective in actual situations than on written tests. Abstract ideas and theories are not likely to be trusted by ESTPs until they have been tested in experience. They may have to work harder than other types to achieve in school, but can do so when they see the relevance.\n\nESTPs do best in careers needing realism, action, and adaptability. Examples are engineering, police work, credit investigation, marketing, health technologies, construction, production, recreation, food services, and many kinds of troubleshooting.\nESTPs are strong in the art of living.

They enjoy physical exercise and sports, and usually are good at these.\n\nHow effective they are depends on how much judgment they acquire. They may need to develop their feeling so that they can use their values to provide standards for their behavior, and direction and purpose in their lives.

71,105,Profile of an ISFJ (Naomi),"['ISFJ\nIntroverted Sensing with Feeling\n\nPeople with ISFJ preferences are extremely dependable and devotedly accept responsibilities beyond the call of duty.They have a complete, realistic, and practical respect for the facts.When they see from the facts that something needs to be done, they pause to think about it. If they decide that action will be helpful, they accept the responsibility.They can remember and use any number of facts, but want them all accurate.\n\nThey like everything clearly stated. Their private reactions are often vivid and intense, and sometimes quite unpredictable to others.These private reactions seldom show in their faces, and even when dealing with a crisis, they can look calm and composed. Not until you know them very well do you discover that behind their outer calm they are looking at things from an intensely individual angle, often a delightfully humorous one. When ISFJs are ?œon duty??and dealing with the world, however, their behavior is sound and sensible. ISFJs are thorough, painstaking, hard-working, and patient with particulars and procedures. They can and will do the ?œlittle??things that need to be done to carry a project to completion.Their perseverance tends to stabilize everything with which they are connected.They do not enter into things impulsively, but once in, they are very hard to distract or discourage.They do not quit unless experience convinces them they are wrong.\n\nISFJs often choose careers where they can combine their careful observation and their caring for people, as in the health professions. Other fields attractive to ISFJs are teaching, office work, and occupations that provide services or personal care. ISFJs show their feeling preference in their contacts with the world.They are kind, sympathetic, tactful, and genuinely concerned; traits that make them very supportive to persons in need.\n\nBecause of their concern for accuracy and organization, ISTJs often move into supervisory roles. If they are in charge of something, their practical judgment and appreciation of what works make them conservative and consistent.They take care to collect the facts necessary to support their evaluations and decisions.As they gain experience, they compare the present problem to past situations.\n\nFor an ISFJ, problems may arise if their judgment is not developed. If their feeling preference remains undeveloped, they will not be effective in dealing with the world. They may instead retreat, becoming silently absorbed in their inner reactions to sense-impressions.

72,106,Profile of an INFJ (Naomi),"['INFJ\nIntroverted Intuition with Feeling\n\nPeople with INFJ preferences are great innovators in the field of ideas. They trust their intuitive insights into the true relationships and meanings of things, regardless of established authority or popularly accepted beliefs. Problems only stimulate them?”the impossible takes a little longer, but not much.\n\nThey are independent and individualistic, being governed by inspirations that come through intuition. These inspirations seem so valid and important that they sometimes have trouble understanding why everyone does not accept them.Their inner independence is often not conspicuous because INFJs value harmony and fellowship; they work to persuade others to approve of and cooperate with their purposes.They can be great leaders when they devote themselves to carrying out a sound inspiration, attracting followers by their enthusiasm and faith.\n\nThey lead by winning (rather than demanding) acceptance of their ideas.\nThey are most content in work that satisfies both their intuition and their feeling. The possibilities that interest them most concern people. Teaching particularly appeals to them, whether in higher education, or through the arts or ministry. Their intuition provides insight into the deeper meanings of the subject and they take great satisfaction in aiding the development of individual students.\n\nWhen their interests lie in technical fields, INFJs may be outstanding in science, or research and development. Intuition suggests new approaches to problems and feeling generates enthusiasm that sparks their energies. Intuition powered by feeling may be of immense value in any field if not smothered in a routine job.\n\nSome problems may result from the INFJ?™s single-minded devotion to inspirations. They may see the goal so clearly that they fail to look for other things that might conflict with the goal. It is also important that their feeling is developed, since this will supply necessary judgment. If their judgment is undeveloped, they will be unable to evaluate their own inner vision and will not listen to feedback from others.

73,107,Profile of an ESFP (Naomi),"['ESFP\nExtraverted Sensing with Feeling\n\nESFP people are friendly, adaptable realists. They rely on what they can see, hear, and know first-hand. They good-naturedly accept and use the facts around them, whatever these are.They look for a satisfying solution instead of trying to impose any ?œshould??or ?œmust??of their own.They are sure that a solution will turn up once they have grasped all of the facts.\n\nThey solve problems by being adaptable, and often can get others to adapt, too. People generally like them well enough to consider any compromise they suggest.They are unprejudiced, open-minded, and tolerant of most everyone?”including themselves.They take things as they are and thus may be very good at easing a tense situation and pulling conflicting factions together.\n\nWith their focus on the current situation and realistic acceptance of what exists, they can be gifted problem solvers. Because they are not necessarily bound by a need to follow standard procedures or preferred methods, they are often able to see ways of achieving a goal by ?œusing??the existing rules, systems, or circumstances in new ways, rather than allowing them to be roadblocks.\n\nThey are actively curious about people, activities, food, objects, scenery, or anything new presented to their senses.Their expert abilities in using their senses may show in: (a) a continuous ability to see the need of the moment and turn easily to meet it, (b) the skillful handling of people and conflicts, (c) the ability to absorb, apply, and remember great numbers of facts, or (d) an artistic taste and judgment.\n\nThey make their decisions by using the personal values of feeling rather than the logical analysis of thinking.Their feeling makes them tactful, sympathetic, interested in people, and especially good at handling human contacts.They may be too easy in matters of discipline.They learn far more from first-hand experience than from books, and do better in actual situations than on written tests. Abstract ideas and theories are not likely to be trusted by ESFPs until they have been tested in experience.\n\nThey may have to work harder than other types to achieve in school, but can do so when they see the relevance.\nESFPs do best in careers needing realism, action, and adaptability. Examples are health services, sales, design, transportation, entertainment, secretarial or office work, food services, supervising work groups, machine operation, and many kinds of troubleshooting.\nESFPs are strong in the art of living.They get a lot of fun out of life, which makes them good company.They enjoy their material possessions and take the time to acquire and care for them.They find much enjoyment in good food, clothes, music, and art.They enjoy physical exercise and sports and usually are good at these.\n\nHow effective they are depends on how much judgment they acquire. They may need to develop their feeling so that they can use their values to provide standards for their behavior, and direction and purpose in their lives. If their judgment is not developed enough to give them any character or stick-to-it-iveness, they are in danger of adapting mainly to their own love of a good time.\n\nInferior function (Ni):\nTriggers for the Inferior Function\n??Excessive focus on the future\n??Closing off of options\n??Excessive structured activity\n\nForms of the Grip Experience\n??Internal confusion\n??Inappropriate attribution of meaning\n??Grandiose vision\n\nWays of Returning to Equilibrium\n??Making contingency plans\n??Resassurance by others regarding ?œdire??consequences\n??Helping by others in setting priorities\n\nNew Knowledge\n??Less fear of possibilities\n??Appreciation of the unknown\n??Access to their own intuition\n\nSource: Was That Really Me?: How Everyday Stress Brings Out Our Hidden Personality']","['Creators', 'Personality', 'ESFP - Performer']",ESFP - Performer
74,108,Profile of an ISTJ (Naomi),"['ISTJ\nIntroverted Sensing with Thinking\n\nPeople with ISTJ preferences are extremely dependable and have a complete, realistic, and practical respect for the facts.They absorb, remember, and use any number of facts and are careful about their accuracy.When they see that something needs to be done, they accept the responsibility, often beyond the call of duty.They like everything clearly stated.\nTheir private reactions, which seldom show in their faces, are often vivid and intense. Even when dealing with a crisis they look calm and composed. Not until you know them very well do you discover that behind their outer calm they are viewing the situation from an intensely individual angle. When ISTJs are ?œon duty??and dealing with the world, however, their behavior is sound and sensible.\n\nISTJs are thorough, painstaking, systematic, hard-working, and careful with particulars and procedures. Their perseverance tends to stabilize everything with which they are connected. They do not enter into things impulsively, but once committed, they are very hard to distract or discourage.\n\nISTJs often choose careers where their talents for organization and accuracy are rewarded. Examples are accounting, civil engineering, law, production, construction, health careers, and office work.They often move into supervisory and management roles. If they are in charge of something, their practical judgment and valuing of procedure makes them consistent and conservative, assembling the necessary facts to support their evaluations and decisions. They look for solutions to present problems in the successes of the past.With time they become masters of even the smallest elements of their work, but don?™t give themselves any special credit for this knowledge.\n\nThey may encounter problems if they expect everyone to be as logical and analytical as they are. They then run the danger of inappropriately passing judgment on others or overriding less forceful people.A useful rule is to use their thinking to make decisions about inanimate objects or their own behavior, and to use their perception to understand others. If they use their senses to see what really matters to others, so that it becomes a fact to be respected, they may go to generous lengths to help.\n\nAnother problem may arise if the ISTJ?™s thinking remains undeveloped. They may retreat, becoming absorbed with their inner reactions to sense-impressions, with nothing of value being produced.They may also tend to be somewhat suspicious of imagination and intuition, and not take it seriously enough.\n\nInferior function (Ne)\nTriggers for the Inferior Function\n??Issues of reality\n??Anything unknown\n??Overdoing their own type\n\nForms of the Grip Experience\n??Loss of control over facts and details\n??Impulsiveness\n??Catastrophizing\n\nWays of Returning to Equilibrium\n??Need to hit bottom\n??Being taken seriously by others\n??Being helped with overwhelming details\n\nNew Knowledge\n??Broadened perspective\n??Clarified values\n??Flexibility in relationships\n\nSource: Was That Really Me?: How Everyday Stress Brings Out Our Hidden Personality', ""The ISTJ that I know (my father) has this tendency to become paranoid and suspicious of other people whenever someone does something that he doesn't understand. He just automatically assumes that they are up to no good, and then obsesses about it to the annoyance of everyone else.\n\nHow would you explain that trait using cognitive functions? or is this unrelated to mbti?

77,111,Profile of an INTJ (Naomi),"['INTJ\nIntroverted Intuition with Thinking\n\nPeople with INTJ preferences are relentless innovators in thought as well as action. They trust their intuitive insights into the true relationships and meanings of things, regardless of established authority or popularly accepted beliefs. Their faith in their inner vision can move mountains. Problems only stimulate them?”the impossible takes a little longer, but not much.They are the most independent of all the types, sometimes to the point of being stubborn.They place a high value on competence?”their own and others??\n\nBeing sure of the worth of their inspirations, INTJs want to see them worked out in practice, applied and accepted by the rest of the world; they are willing to spend any time and effort to that end.They have determination, perseverance, and will drive others almost as hard as they drive themselves.Although their preference is for intuition, they can, when necessary, focus on the details of a project to realize their vision.\n\nINTJs often value and use confidently their intuitive insights in fields such as science, engineering, invention, politics, or philosophy.The boldness of their intuition may be of immense value in any field, and should not be smothered in a routine job.\n\nSome problems may arise from the INTJ?™s single-minded concentration on goals.They may see the end so clearly that they fail to look for other things which might conflict with the goal.Therefore they need to actively seek the viewpoints of others.\n\nINTJs may neglect their feeling to the point of ignoring other people?™s values and feelings. If they do, they may be surprised by the bitterness of their opposition. An INTJ?™s own feeling has to be reckoned with also, for if too much suppressed, it may build up pressure and find expression in inappropriate ways.Their feeling needs to be used constructively, such as through appreciation of other people. Given their talent for analysis, appreciation may be hard for them, but they will find it helpful on the job as well as in personal relationships.\n\nTo be effective, INTJs must develop their thinking to supply needed judgment. If their judgment is undeveloped, they will be unable to criticize their own inner vision, and will not listen to the opinions of others. They will therefore be unable to shape their inspirations into effective action.\n\nInferior function (Se):\nTriggers for the Inferior Function\n??Dealing with details\n??Unexpected events\n??Excessive extraverting\n\nForms of the Grip Experience\n??Obsessive focus on external data\n??Overindulgence in sensual pleasure\n??Adversarial attitude toward the outer world\n\nWays of Returning to Equilibrium\n??Time alone to recharge\n??Lightening of usual schedule\n??Avoidance by others of giving advice or suggestions\n\nNew Knowledge\n??Adaptability to outer details\n??Pleasure in temperate sensuality\n??More realistic goals\n\nSource: Was That Really Me?: How Everyday Stress Brings Out Our Hidden Personality', 'This is pretty congruent with the other descriptions of the INTJ.

79,113,What's your favorite MBTI type?,"[""(saw this in another forum thought it would be interesting to hear from other ENFP'ers)\n\nIn your experience, what's your favorite MBTI type to date?"", ""I've been in a relationship before with an ENFP guy...and from the experience, I would say that INFPs and ENFPs make great friends. We love exploring, trying new things, being silly...but as boyfriend/girlfriend, INFP/ENFP couples don't work. Neither of us could resolve things when there was conflict, we were both too accomodating. Meanwhile (not surprisingly), passive-aggressiveness just kept growing until it was overwhelming.\n\nI think what I can say for sure is that us NFP types need to date NJ types of some sort."", 'Yeah, I think you guys are both right from my personal experiences - an ENFP best fits with an xNxJ. Though I consider myself a &amp;quot;mature&amp;quot; ENFP - recognizing my inherent weaknesses and always trying to develop the skills to overcome them - I know it really helps to have a partner that\'s at least a &amp;quot;J&amp;quot; to help keep me on top of details and organization.\n\nI think \'N\' is required to have a partner that\'s not too rigid, can think about possibilities (enjoy doing so). I dated an ISFJ for several years and while she was a very sweet and loving woman, she seemed to have little interest in pondering life\'s bigger questions.\n\nWith the exception of one person my experiences with ISTJ\'s has been extraordinarily disappointing. I think I read someone type in the ENFPforum website that this type is like a soul sucker for ENFPs. I don\'t know if I agree with that but boy... they have a strong tendency of being closed minded. But to be fair, I think ENFPs frustrate ISTJs even more. ;)\n\nAs for xNFJ, my longest relationship was with one - which I suppose is positive in large part. There is definitely a natural pairing with some gotchas. I have noticed one frustrating detractor with her and other xNFJ friends is when the Feeling and Judging are particularly strong it is incredibly hard to reason with them. No matter how you state the &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; they struggle empathizing with any point of view other than their own. Then if you toss in the &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; you get someone who is sometimes iNtuiting things that aren\'t remotely true based upon their Feelings and then coming down hard and decisively (J). So you end up having to defend yourself against accusations that come out of left field.\n\nI probably just offended a lot of really nice xNFJs just now. ;) So I welcome any thoughts on how I might better interpret interactions with them.\n\nI do wonder about xNTJ (esp INTJ\'s) - the few female ones I do know are remarkably easy to both converse and reason with. But simultaneously the two I know seem cold and removed - less capable of the warmth and affection that FJ\'s seem to be readily capable of.\n\nSo proving that I am a ""P"" - I decisively have *not* figured out what my favorite MBTI type is. ;)', '', '', 'I find pretty much all N types fascinating. My boyfriend and I are both ENFPs, and so is one of my good friends, and when we see each other we literally just don\'t stop talking until we\'re too exhausted to speak anymore. I think I find ENFJs less easy, just because they are socially assertive I think I get a bit intimidated by that. Whereas ENFPs are more like ""OMG, HI"". I have a lot of male INFP friends who I really get on with, and more recently I\'ve found myself forming really deep friendshops with INFJs, although I do find the icy exterior a bit disconcerting. One of my good friends at the moment is an INFJ I met through doing a homeless network (typical, right?) and he\'s so funny. Like, he understands so much about philosophy and politics and stuff, but he\'s not all that interested in people. Like, I\'m really into finding out who people are and what makes them tick, but he\'s just not and I always find it really bizaare. I wonder if it\'s the extroverted/introverted thing? Both he and my close INFP friend are just wonderfully original people though. I really value the different perspectives they give me on things.\n\nNTs I also find really interesting and have fun engaging with, but unfortunately I can find them a bit cold, which frustrates me sometimes. When having big political chats about world issues, I do find my INTJ friend over rationalising things which need a bit more social understanding and empathy. He is great chat though, and very clever which I really admire in a person.\n\nI don\'t think I really get on very well with S types. Not, don\'t get on, just don\'t get. At best, they find me a bit odd and I find them a bit...not limited, but not able to see the bigger picture/think outside of what\'s in front of them? At worst, I know an ESFP who I like but we just clash all the time. He gets frustrates with me not always being completely aware of the world around me, and I get frustrated by his inability to view the world as it could/should be. He\'s also manipulative - though as I understand it, that\'s an ESFP at their worst, which is also a criticism to be made of ENFPs.\n\nso yeah NFs first, NTs second and then all the S types, I guess.', ""As an ENFP I would most likely choose ENFP, INFJ, INFP, well, any NF for a friend, but for a date it would be INTJ, becouse I find them fascinating (I'm a bit of sapiosexual :)).\n\nSo, it's like Upsideteacup said: NF first, NT second... and STJ's comes last.\n\nBut if I had to choose just one type it would definitely be INTP."", 'I would date INTP, INFJ, or INTJ most likely. I got an ENTP friend who is super hilarious. My roommate is ISTP and his wife is INTP and they are pretty cool people. I tend to stray from ENFJ, ENTJ.', 'Trikalaptops - I know a few ESTJs and couldn\'t imagine having relationship with them (of course, the majority of them are males), it would be a real ""clash"" on perspectives of the world.\n\nSanja - INTP is an interesting match for ENFPs. Don\'t know any female INTPs, but have a couple of male INTP friends I get along well with.\n\nOzam2988 - Why do you think an ENFP should stay away from ENFJ\'s? I have my opinion that\'s only been immaturely informed on one ENFJ woman I know. What are your thoughts? Curious...\n\nIn a work relationship, I get along amazingly well with two ENTJs who report to me. They are easy to rationalize with, discuss concepts openly and work with decisively. However, I could see in a relationship role they might be the types that needs to either be the ""Commander"" or the commanded - not the egalitarian mindset I believe most ENFPs have for relationships.', ""I have never dated an ESFJ but I'm attracted to them. Their extraverted feeling makes up for my complete lack of it. I've never met an INTP woman knowingly but I would REALLY like the chance to meet (and date) one."", ""@Alejandro, I dated an ENFJ for a couple years. She was quick to judge and liked to complain about everything. Couldn't reason about things really. Not open minded as much as me. Drove me crazy. She was Co-Dependent and pretty clingy. Didn't understand that I needed time to recharge my brain (since we are the most introverted of the extroverts.) Although I do get along with ENFJ's friend wise but not in relationships. I am drawn to other ENFPs and INFJ's. Curious about INTPs since they are most likely gonna be the gamer chicks."", 'Oh she would just complain about anything really. Food not tasting good enough, or anything. She was quite the judge as well. Got on my nerves. Cant really remember too much anymore. It was toxic. She tried to get back together with me a year after that and I was like NOPE, chuck testa. Kind of hard to believe she was an NF. But she was def expressive and her feelings would come out like a boiling tea pot. That lead Fe. Thats not that bad though, I dated an ENTJ for a year and that is probably the worst pair ever for ENFP.', ""Ozman - your experience is similar to the one experience I have had with a female ENFJ that works with me. Very challenging to rationalize with, quickly jumps to defensive conclusions (which turn offensive) and it's very hard to talk her down from an agitated state."", ""Edit: Whoops! New here. Didn't realize this was an ENFP thread.\n\nAs an INTP, I'm not very compatible at all... But romantically, the only men that have really caught my attention were assumed ISTPs.\n\nAs friends, I think any of the rational categories would work out... But as an 18 year old college student, I don't actually know many rational people.\n\n"", ""I've heard that your opposite is actually the most compatible. This is because their strengths are your weaknesses and vice versa. You're opposites but in a way that is complementary.

85,123,Not an INTP but I love you guys.,"[""Infj here and I just wanted to say I genuinely enjoy the INTP type than most others. I have had a friendship with an INTP that has spanned years. Our friendship works in an odd way. We constantly offer new insight to one another, often completely opposite. They think of whatever I have missed and vice versa. They offer a more structured logical view and offer a more humanized emotional view. I think I have benefited more from the intp than any other type.\n\nI do have a question though. How would you describe your train of thought? How do you see the world? What types do you enjoy the most? What do you think of infj's?"", 'Whoa, this is new. I don\'t think I\'ve met anyone who prefers the strange and complicated INTP type.\n\nHmmm, I believe I\'ve only really gotten to know one INFJ and it was a friendship. It worked perfectly because my quirky personality inspired her to express more of her individuality, which surprised me in the most wonderful ways every time I saw more and more of it, and in return I was inspired by her balance, her calm outlook, and her kindness. Win/ Win.\n\nI\'m not sure how I\'d feel about one in a romantic relationship and would have to try it out to find an answer but I\'d definitely be open to that kind of personality. Although typically (and unfortunately), I seem to be more interested in people who are less sensitive and more reserved.\n\nI don\'t think any INTP is going to be able to describe their train of thought in a way that makes sense to others.\n\nMine, personally, is very erratic and I\'m in a different state of mind every week, if not every day. I get absorbed and lost in things, although never what I\'m ""supposed"" to be doing, and my passions cycle continuously. My thoughts bounce around in ways that even I can\'t follow but that\'s because it seems to be more about the wandering than the arriving.\n\nThe view of the world for me and a lot of INTPs isn\'t usually very positive at all. I find myself disappointed every day because I see so much potential in the raw materials but am surrounded by ignorance and conformity. Society feels like a big trap where you know you don\'t belong and want to disassociate yourself, but know that even if you do, you\'ll still be unsatisfied that the world isn\'t what you dream.\n\nWe have it rough, man.\n\nBut that\'s why it\'s good that we can create such rich worlds inside our heads. We distance ourselves a bit, wander around inside our minds for a while, recharge, and come back with fresh eyes.', ""The reason I find Intps so interesting is because of how you wonder around in your own world.\nWhen you have a different world and it is so vast and rich with your own creations of thought it is really something unique because a lot of people will have them, but most of them will be dry, small, and sort of predictable. When I first met my intp friend I instantly knew they were a thousand miles away from me even though I was shaking their hand. It took years for them to let me in step by step and I feel there is no end to the depth they have. I feel I could explore in there forever. I love people who think their own way and are complex. For me getting to know people is something I like to do with almost everyone I meet but when I meet someone I think might be an intp I usually make extra effort to enter their world and explore. Also the Intp expresses a lot of the same frustrations that you did. They are a writer, in film school and when they have a vision that is not fully realized they seem to withdraw but with some gentle prodding asking about their thoughts, creations and future plans they open up to me once again. They have a beautiful mind and have gave me the best friendship I have had thus far in my life.\nI can see how the sensitive side could cramp an intp. They rather not be bothered by a needier person, when they have some much to process of their own. The only time Infj's will be emotional with you is if they have let you in their inner sanctum. It is all or nothing and for me when I decide it is even more gradual after that. We too are withdrawn from the outside and only venture out to seek what interests us. We have very few close friends and even fewer acquaintances.\n\n"", ""Please spread the word. There needs to be more of you who see things like that.\n\nUnlike most INTPs, I'm a pretty emotional person so its not sensitivity that makes me turn away from certain people. It's more about balance.\n\nYou can have all the intelligence and confidence in the world but still not a shred of balance in your life. It's something I don't have and so I look for it in others and yeah, it tends to be in those who are less sensitive.\n\nAgain, I'd have to meet more INFJs to see for myself but I definitely think it works.\n"", ""Will do. I wouldn't have seen it if they didn't let me see it. It just takes time to get to know you guys I think."", ""Depends on the INTP, I'll admit there is that sense of dissatisfaction behind most experiences but I find this to be an unbelievable source of motivation and strength. There is the world I need to deal with (going through the motions, work, assignments I'm not interested in, etc), then there is the work I want to do.\n\nAs we get older we get more freedom and are thus able to move into exploring the avenues we are compelled to, just as when we get older INTPs gain greater use of their perception (extraverted intuition) and can see value in areas we previously found without value.\n\nThe only reason I really do anything is to answer the questions I need answered, to find the information that will put me at ease. The trap is that search for truth never really ends since one thought always leads naturally to the next.\n\nINFJs have an uncanny ability to attribute depth and give meaning to that process of thought, to find the meaningful pattern behind simply knowing. I find the big-picture insights provided by the INFJ to be both profound and springboards for deeper thought (which make for great afternoon conversation).\n\nOne of my best friends is INFJ and he is probably the most interpersonally aware person I know, I'm not even sure how I can explain the relationship in a few words without limiting it.\n\nThe depth you see in an INTP is probably tenfold in an INFJ when it comes to a subject they are contemplating. Whereas I can know a lot about something and generate ideas surrounding it, an INFJ can be aware of so much more in the moment it really is quite amazing. I find that bouncing the INFJ's awareness and my ideas back and forth in conversation just makes for really great and even stimulating exploration. What also amazes me is how the INFJ just cherishes that sort of thing by remembering it, holding onto it, and even nurturing the ideas, whereas my mind is already following the next train of thought.\n"", 'I really appreciate the reply and would like to say that what you have described is in a lot of ways how my friendship with my intp friend works. You have found words that describe it and well that is more than what I have done haha. I am still trying to mull over the whole friendship and bring out what it is that makes it work in a way that it can be understood. I am deciphering feelings and experiences and you have helped a lot. Thank you.', ""It warms my pebbly heart whenever people express appreciation for the INTP. Thanks. I really really wish I knew some INFJs.\n\nUgh, where are you all though. I've checked all the crannies in the bookstores."", ""The train of thought crashed up in the mountains with all the survivors going in different directions. some live some die but the others have transcended this plain of existence only to come back and leave in the blink of an eye. Well that is mine at least. The way I have recently started to see the world as my play box and the people in it as my toys. The only people I know are from a forum I'm part of and their all INTPs."", ""I've unfortunately only known one INTP in person but as kmaco says the back and forth interplay between us was phenomenal! As an INFJ, I identify most with Ni and the insights I generate from the information I've gathered in life. I feel the most gratified when someone appreciates this in me and the INTP that I knew genuinely recognized and admired this quality. I in turn admired his deep thought, serious nature and self-control along with his quirkiness. His honesty and ability to read me was off the charts. The added bonus was that child-like Fe that just made me want to nurture him:)"", ""I find that i have an overall positive view of the world and life (moreso than many intps) but more than once I've said something in a group setting that was meant to be a positive and interesting take on a subject, and everyone acts like i'm a downer for suggeting a different viewpoint. My thought process is kind of like a never ending english paper monologue in the background, with maybe a song stuck in my head mixed in, plus daydreaming situations that will never happen and/or connecting ideas to find new perspectives. I also think most intps dont like to mentally dwell on negative things in our lives such as upcoming obligations or unpleasantries, and people who do dwell on these things and voice them to us tend to drive us crazy."", ""INTPs are indeed an interesting bunch. I find myself somewhat attracted to your unrelenting intellect, yet how easygoing you'll appear on the outside despite of it. My best friend since childhood is an INTP.\nMyself I'm an INTJ who happens to have highly developed Ti and Ne, so I can relate quite a bit to the INTP perspective, even though it's still a bit foreign to me.\nThe thing I can relate to the most is the breaking out of society bit that Sierra0023 brought up. I'm just incredibly bored with it. I'm also bored with how normal people are. I like weird things, and weird people. I always want something more than meets the eyes. I care less about people's opinions each passing day because of it."", 'I have to say that I have had a rough time as an INTP. It is always gratifying to hear about a positive experience or view, so thank you!\n\nPersonal experience:\nImagine this: Attempting to attach a string to the first cognitive thought ever conceived and then attach that string to every related thought and so on and so on. (But that\'s impossible!) doesn\'t matter, keep trying.\n\nPersonally, I think the hardest part of being an INTP is that you feel like you know how to solve someone else\'s puzzle but that you just don\'t have the right to reach out and do so. You end up trying to give instructions to help others who often don\'t appreciate it. But trying to get others to understand is almost a compulsion. So, I am left to excitedly celebrate my epiphanies in my head whence they came.\n\nI have been labeled as both ""Hot blooded"" because of my passion for ideas and ""cold hearted"" because of my stand off-ish-ness by the same people. Mostly because I am quiet until something intrigues me and then I go off on tangents.\n\nI think a lot of INTPs are misunderstood. I can\'t be the only one that likes to revel in the beauty of the world as well as try to understand it. I may make decisions based off of logic, but I still HAVE emotion. :)\n\nMost off all, I love to look at things from a different perspective than most others (which sometimes creates a lot of tension). When I don\'t see a new angle, I get frustrated and don\'t feel like I am even worth talking to.', 'Wow people *want* to hang around INTP\'s?\n\n^^ What Sierra said, few people share this perspective.\n\nTrain of thought:\nDefinitely very scatterbrained. Like brainstorming. Non linear. Very circuitous. When thinking about a topic I wander around it in loose circles looking at it from all sorts of angles and tangents then bounce around until I eventually I make some grande connections.\n\nHow do I view the world?:\nMuch like the others in this post... it seems like a big silly mess and not buit for us at all. Since most of the population is \'S\' ... (around 65-75%) and roughly 50% is SJ... the world is literally not built for us. Corporations don\'t market to us. We have almost no role models. And most people just don\'t get excited about the things we get excited about. It\'s so hard to find common ground, and to get excited about the everyday S reality. I think what I find most exciting is learning / researching, then building a wikipedia in my brain about some topic... finding all these interesting connections and then distilling it down into something with a lot of logical clarity. I love sharing that. But few really wanna buy what we are selling. It\'s an extreme pain in the ass, but has slowly made me more driven to carve out my own niche for myself. And what Psefi said... ""I like weird things"" Things are definitely not weird enough / interesting most of the time.\n\nWhat types do I enjoy the most?\nI seem to get along the most with other N types, and I think I can get along with most of them, and would enjoy meeting any of them. The types I\'ve been closest to are ENTP and INFJ. If I had to pick I\'d like to meet more INFJs, ENFJs, INTPs, ENTPs.\n\nI like INFJ\'s a lot. Particularly the ones that are more analytical, and less ""mystical"". The level of \'N\' type closeness we can have is absolutely wonderful. And they support my baby \'Fe\' so it works out quite well.\n\n', ""When an INTP shares a thought, it's like you've been hit with a snowflake compared to the glacier of information that was digested to reach that conclusion. More often than not, it makes absolutely no sense and I have to basically backtrack and make peoples' heads hurt trying to maybe have a hope of tying it together the way it went into my head, heavily condensed into a cogent sentence or couple of sentences. Language really is not enough sometimes."", 'I am so thankful for this thread! I signed up as I was feeling insecure about how many people just dont like me let alone get me and was begining to feel like a freak who needed help. THANK YOU EVERYONE!', ""I've often considered the way I see the world as a curse. Often times it feels like reality is just a huge disappointment. That is because no matter how well something is done, I always see how it could be better and tend to look at everything as an inferior concept. It's really difficult for me to appreciate things the way they are, because I'm always envisioning how much better they could be.\n\nHowever, it's not that simple with this so called curse. I am easily distracted by my thoughts in such a way that the most basic things set me off course in a conversation. For example, you could be having a conversation with me and pop open a can of soda. Instantly in the back of my mind I'm thinking about the leverage that allowed you to pop open that can of soda. Then I'm thinking about the invention of the tab on the can of soda. Which leads me to the manufacturing process for the aluminum can the soda is in. Then just when I'm getting back on track you pick up a pencil and start writing something so now I'm thinking about Lead, tress, and burn in printers.\n\nTo top it off, huge communication issues. Because my thought process is abstract and conceptual. So when someone asks me to explain something I've done to them, I have to break it down into english which takes time. This leads me to skipping key points, mumbling, or just spacing out for 3 minutes while I compile a abstract landscape into sequential english.\n\nTo explain it visually.. What would it look like in my mind.. Is rather difficult to explain. However over the years the best explanation I've come up with is to imagine a world where everything is a ghost like image. Every tree, person, building, etc is like a ghost object. You can see it, but it's mysty and constantly changing shape. And every object in this reality is a thought of mine. As I build computer code at work, I visualize the components in this ghost like landscape, I know what all the ghosts are and what they are for and what they do and I can translate them to actual code objects on my comptuer screen as I build it in reality. But then someone asks me for a breakdown and now I have to connect all these ghost like abstract thoughts to words.\n\nWhat's worse is trying to connect my thoughts sequentially. It's a 360 degree thought process where anything could be anywhere, there is no sequence. My ability to know what goes where and in what order is subconscious, I do it without putting in any effort. But when I translate it to words, I tend to go something like A -> Z -> T -> B.. etc.. All the pieces come out, but in the wrong order."", 'I know I think differently than other people, but I don\'t know exactly how it is different. I can tell that my conclusions are not the the first one\'s that other people come to. Because I can recognize when people are outside the normal thought patter, I have an easier time play ""translator"" to help people properly express what they are trying to get across.\n\nMy own thoughts are always miles ahead of anything I want to express to other people. Slowing down or backtracking often derails the thought process (if not several at once) and I usually become annoyed that I bothered to try and convey information in the first place. Sometimes it seems like I change directions in a conversation erratically, but really I just didn\'t feel like slowing down to fill in everyone else on the logical jumps I made.', ""We all have our strong and admirable traits. Ours are just hidden inside out minds. If people could engage us on subject of our interest and we could trust them enough not to poke fun at it because it isn't normal or doesn't 'feel' right...you'll get to know an INTP. Once those floodgates open to the right person, it all comes out in an excited mess of train-of-thought gibberish.\n\nOnce we can stop ourselves to gather our thoughts together properly and get over the excitement that someone actually cares about what we have to say....and start over in a way they can understand, it's an amazing thing for an INTP."", 'The http://www.air-huarache.co.uk/ wind,

After all, we are but the sum of our lives (and personality) and I'd still have my memories intact and I'd still be an INTJ enneagram 6w5 So/Sp tritype: 649 so I'd go about the world the same way as ever.\n\nProblems to be taken into account:\n\nA: I don't exist as a woman according to my country and thus it would be really hard to get into the system or have it changed to my new... situation.\n\nB: I would be alienated from family and friends since they wouldn't really know me or rather, it would be hard for them to understand that I am their child/sibling/friend since they don't remember my physical appearance.\n\nThen ofc the whole thing about me wanting a child in time would come up as an issue since I would still be attracted to girls and would want a child that has mine and her DNA and not some random person. This however is less of a problem in modern society since we are getting closer (if we haven't succeeded already) to by medical means allow 2 girls to have a child together without the requirement of a guy in the process.\n\nIf this was only for a day, I would mess with people's heads.

I mean, eat someone\'s mouth off why don\'t you guys?\n\nAfter that I would experiment with orgasms and compare them to a male. And then theorize if there is a metaphysical component to why they feel different if they do.\n\nSecond, I would attempt to make myself experience emotions.\n\nThird, I would attempt to gage if a gender change altered what I am attracted to.\n\nFourth, I would pee while squatting.\n\nFifth, I would see what more I could get away with as a female as compared to a male.\n\nSixth, I would look for aspects of gender discrimination without the bias of having grown up as that gender.\n\nLast, I would hang out somewhere unsafe and find a sexual predator. Then I would send that low life to the after life after a bit of ""play time.""

88,126,Who is the ISTP most attracted to?,"[""Well I'm an INTP raiding your category.\n\nI find myself attracted to ISTPs the most but I'm not sure there's actually any sort of compatibility there. I have so much appreciation for all the qualities the type seems to possess but that's about all I know.\n\nSo someone please help me out, if you will, and let me know what the ISTP guy is really looking for in a girl so I can figure out whether to keep trying it out or listen to what MBTI recommends for once. :P\n\n"", ""My brother is an ISTP so I've had a lot of experiences with them lol.\n\nISTP's don't talk much. They live it their heads more then we do. And it generally has two moods play...and play. Kinda like us. lol\n\nSince like us. Play is work. So, like us, you have to dive into THEIR play to be noticed. Just like most people wooing an INTP would need to dive into our ever changing interests to be noticed.\nISTP's love ingenuity. My best times with my brother were the rare occasions when I bested him at building with legos or making circuits. Anything with tools and weapons he's amazing at learning so it's fun to surprise him once in a while.\n\nThey aren't abstract thinkers....and you'll be able to run them in circles in a debate. I suggest keeping that in mind, as my brother was never very fond of either. So I assume if you're wooing then it would be something to avoid.\n\nummm. I'm not sure what else to say. Maybe ask questions? I'd be happy to answer."", ""I could be described an ISTP with a well developed Ni and Fi. This is outside the narrow definition of a type. I use this as a tool to understand my strengths and quarantine/develop weaknesses. Taking it as a label semi-defeats the purpose of growth, because when someone labels them self they believe that that is what they are. and you are what you believe. Anyway I'm just trying to give you some perspective.\nDon't underestimate the power of the dark side Ti. Debates are no problem. The second you think you're 'winning' a debate is probably when you've lost. It's not about winning, it's about learning. It's not about being able to say that you always kept the original subject in mind and therefore you have the supreme concentration, once again a debate is learning and exploring. The person who learns the most wins. The people who love to 'win' debates amuse me. I let them think whatever they want. The farther their conceptions get from reality the more power they hand over. This is Ti shadow warfare.\n\n@Sierra\nWhat I'm looking for is mature women who want to be friends, have sex (mentally) and then have sex.\nWhat I always have my eye open for: A woman who enjoys intellect, feeling and caring for others, but is tempered and not overly emotionally leaky, a tactician and an invaluable ally whether the situation be selling merchandise or conducting war, is good at cooking, knows how to treat children like adults with respect so that they will grow to fill those shoes quickly, no bullshit, honest open communication, enjoys giving head, getting fucked, not ashamed to express their sexuality, NOT overly confrontational, arrogant, or self-important (This is a mood killer in women. Play on your Yin strengths and don't be overly forceful. It's not inferiority or less than. The Yin can control the Yang because it contains it, but do not stifle it or you will lose it) What else? Being attractive helps but is not as necessary as the more of the above conditions you fill.\nI would much rather have a homely woman who's about her business than some beautiful butterfly who flits to the next best thing."", '', '', '@iLove\nTHANK YOU.\nThat was incredibly helpful and lines up pretty well with the ISTPs I know.\n\n""What I\'m looking for is mature women who want to be friends, have sex (mentally) and then have sex.

I could never get this guy to give me the time of day but he\'d give me a small fragment of his attention every once in a while for a short period of time. He randomly came around again and we got talking.

They live it their heads more then we do. And it generally has two moods play...and play. Kinda like us. lol\n\nSince like us. Play is work.

My best times with my brother were the rare occasions when I bested him at building with legos or making circuits. Anything with tools and weapons he's amazing at learning so it's fun to surprise him once in a while.\n\nThey aren't abstract thinkers....and you'll be able to run them in circles in a debate. I suggest keeping that in mind, as my brother was never very fond of either. So I assume if you're wooing then it would be something to avoid.\n\nummm. I'm not sure what else to say.

There are those super serious types who frown upon it - generally higher-ups. But the work gets done so, why not, right? I think for me it may be a ?˜coping mechanism??I use for having to be stuck with being around people for 8 hours a day in a close environment. Humor. I do not know how I?™d survive without it. It?™s gotta be the good stuff though. Usually involves satire, self- deprecation, and making fun about all the things wrong about the workplace. People I really like, I?™ll play with when they?™re mad about something. I don?™t like seeing my friend down &amp;amp; so, I?™ll put on my Jamaican accent and ask, ?œSTE-phen - Why dee frowny face today??

89,127,MBTI Type Preferences & Compatibilities,"[""Project Evolove seems to subscribe to the Keirsey theory that opposites attract. In my own (long, sordid) experience, this doesn't even come close. See http://pstypes.blogspot.com/2009/03/myers-briggs-compatibility-part-1.html . Which theory works for you?\n\nOn a related topic, I find that people's self-reported MBTI Types are often suspect. Does anyone else notice this?"", ""All the theories have some merit if you ask me, even Keirsey's opposites attract. In Please Understand Me II however he updates his theory to &quot;the opposites of non-perception functions&quot;, ie he recommends S with S and N with N. For example INTPs in that book are recommended with ENFJ. (You could still argue that those are opposites since the N in an INTP is Extraverted Intuition and the N in an ENFJ is Introverted Intuition, but I digress.)\n\nPersonally I think type doesn't guarantee compatibility. I believe there is a possibility that any type could work out well with another, provided there is an understanding of each other's communication styles and thought process.\n\nThat being said, of course I have my own preferences. I find the author who hit the nail on the head was Alexander Avila in his book Love Types. He pointed out which types an INTP falls for easily (ESFP/ENFP), and the type that an INTP would work best with (INFJ). (Her pairings can be found through the link for those interested).\n\nAs a cave-dwelling INTP I can tell you that from the limited friendships I do maintain, two of my best friends are ENFJ (female) and INFJ (male). These are people who I could spend an entire day with and not feel it was wasted, the conversational dynamics are just great. My other two great friends are x2 ISTJ (male) and INTJ (male).\n\nAs for your last topic, are people's self-reported MBTI suspect? Probably, especially with the abundance of internet tests out there which fail to properly address the cognitive functions underlying the MBTI system. (I find the best test online that is FREE and tests for functions is @ http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm )\n\nI don't find mistyping to be that big a problem for a couple of reasons. First is that it is pretty easy to find out after a short conversation what type somebody probably is, and you can balance the discrepancies at that point. Second is that we are on the internet on a typology dating site, of course its going to be packed with Intuitives and Introverts :)"", 'Well said, kmaco. I agree on all points, especially ""there is a possibility that any type could work out well with another, provided there is an understanding of each other\'s communication styles and thought process."" PUM II does get closer with ""opposites of non-perception functions.""\n\nI agree that ""it is pretty easy to find out after a short conversation what type somebody probably is, and you can balance the discrepancies at that point."" I think that some people answer questions in any tests aspirationally rather than objectively. There is not much that we can do about it. But this is an argument for not using overly restrictive MBTI filters when searching.\n\nI, too, am happy to find a high concentration of intuitive introverts here at Project Evolove. Quite a refreshing change from the crowd that ""loves to laugh"" and ""workout alot.""\n\n\n\n', '.\n', 'I find myself inescapably attracted to ENFPs, and typically repulsed by most SJ types, so I do believe that opposites attract, though with the caveat that a shared N trait is beyond important for me.\n\nAs far as false reporting, I haven\'t been around the site long enough to form a reliable opinion, though I\'m inclined to assume that people with the I trait in general may have some life experience that would cause a desire to change their type so as to be ""more"" or ""less"" attractive.

Or rationals and their experience with INTPs. Its hard for me to imagine how that would work but some people recommend it."", 'I know of an INFJ/INTP relationship. I can see how it would work, as the INTP and the ENTP are essentially the same cognitive functions, just in different order. She (the INFJ) was definitely attracted to the INTP, but neither of them were good at bringing out the energy in each other.', ""Edit: Withdrawn; lengthy analysis is probably not suitable on a dating website, heh.\n\nI like INFJs. I'll leave it at that."", ""Venx, it's difficult for me to describe how your thought process worries me, so I am going to take a block of your own text and replace type indicators with ethnic races.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe second concern I would have, and maybe it's completely unjustified, involves humour. --black-- humour is generally a little insane. I know --asians-- tend to relish in it also (--philipinos--) but I'm not so sure about --caucasians--. I think they prefer the safer, more gregarious humour of --latinos--. --black-- humour can also be pitch black, without boundaries. I wonder if --caucasians-- would find it sometimes shocking and offensive. Although to us it's just play.\n\nI'm being classic --black guy--, critically focusing on problem areas, but the truth is that I have profound respect and love for --caucasians--. At least I think I do. Responses please.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPeople are not that simple. I understand your need to categorize them, making them more predictable, but take my advice, that road leads nowhere. You will wind up alienating yourself from others far more than attracting them. If you're looking for love, I don't have advice. I don't think love is as simple as a 4 point type indicator.\n\nAlso, remember this... your type indicator is a spectrum. Each letter falls on a line from black to white... Rarely is someone black and rarely is someone white. Often they're somewhere in between. Also, remember this, your personality type... it's not set in stone. You ever meet someone years later and go, &amp;quot;Wow, that guy really made a change!&amp;quot; If not, you will by age 30, I guarantee it."", 'Rafajafar makes a valid point, people are not as simple as 4 letter indicators. Some may be more developed in one aspect and less in another. Whereas others will have personal experiences that lead to growth throughout their life in general. Plus, in most cases, we don\'t really develop our tertiary functions until later in life, unless it was prompted early on. For example, my Ti is a bit more developed because in my family intellect/rational was valued over feeling (Fe) and therefore I had to work at that particular functional aspect.\n\nVenx, in regards to your concerns with INFJs, I don\'t think that is something to worry about it all of our types. It is possible to process and wade through our emotional depths without causing more hurt or getting stuck in the depression. It takes time for most to open up, but once you know how an INFJ reacts to situations it is easier to know how to counter that reaction as well.\nWhile not linked romantically, two of my roommates in college were INTP and ENTP (both males) and we lived harmoniously. In most cases when situations get to INFJs shutting down emotionally (retreating) isn\'t a slap to the face, we get it. We do the same thing. It\'s how most Introverts recharge in general. And while I can\'t speak for all INFJs, what I do know is that I don\'t expect people to fix the situation/turn it around, sometimes all it takes it sitting in the same room - being a physical presence, knowing that person is still there and did not completely disengage. There were times when I felt awful that my roommates and I would sit on the deck and I would just listen to them talk, I did not engage in the conversation but they didn\'t let me leave either.\n\nIn terms of humor, I think that is more depend on the person. Yes, INFJs may be considered ""sensitive"" but I\'m pretty sure we can laugh at some of the same things. I was never offended by anything that was stated by the INTP nor the ENTP that I housed with.', 'Thanks for the insightful post Mehoui.\n\n', 'Hi,\nI was driven to this site because I recently found I am an INTP. I had a relationship with an INTP woman, and it was great. The feeling of connection was immense. We could just communicate. Someday I would like to replicate that.', ""As an infj I find INTPs very charming and interesting. This can be a process if you don't understand each others motivations at first, I have found some INTPs to be a little suspicious regarding emotional expression. But good communication I think can lead to very satisfying relationships between these two types. infjs understand alone time and abstract thinking and enjoy giving what INTPs need when there is trust and rapport built. It can be great. Of course it can also go ary. But overall I am very fond of INTPs ."", ""i wish i could date myself\nwould save so much hassle :P\n\ngenerally, i like the concept of INTJ/P\n\nbut seriously, as Rafajafar mentioned before, it's more complex than 4 letters, and in the same time easier than all the hours(days/weeks) of talking about it, you just feel if you've found someone attractive or not."", 'I have found myself infatuated with ENFPs and ESFPs. I generally have good freinships with INTJs, INTPs, and INFPs.', ""I've greatly enjoyed my time with INFJ/INFP women and men mostly. They're pretty patient and their idealism amuses me in one way or another. I get along well with other INTPs and INTJs but things become static more often. ENTPs I see as bumbling idiots and/or clown type characters. They seem to definitely like me more than I like them, but can be comforting too. It's probably the sexual side of all these types too. Because when you add the instinct factor, my interactions with people appear significantly less than anticipated, and in real life that's just true. I've been attracted to S types but find them more annoying than anything else. They're so unreasonable... so it seems.\n\nBut in summary, the most fulfilling time I have had was spent with an INFP so I want to go down that route again :P"", ""Some of my best friends are INTP's, and the last good dating relationship I had was with an INTP.\n\nI just love you people :)\n\nI don't like stereotypes\n(and after reading the previous posts, I'll be even more careful with my words ;) )\nbut..\nEvery INTP I've met has fascinated me greatly.\nIt's like I want to dive into your brain and swim there in that lovely ocean of knowledge, ideas and theories.\nSo beautiful!\n\nIntelligence for me is a very important aspect in a person, and I can't really deeply connect with someone who is not intelligent enough.\nAnd they also have to have some of the similar type of intelligence as me, too.\nMore in INTP's than in any other types I have noticed deep levels of theoretical intelligence mixed with this almost child-like fascination towards things, all of that topped with some sweet humbleness.\n\nSure, I also have good friends who are feelers or judgers, but INTP's are just..... very special.\n\nAgain, this is how I see it, and I do not claim that every INTP would be like this.\nJust my personal view on the matter ;)\n\n(First message here, be gentle <3)"", ""ENFJ and INFP, but thats only because I've had 2 meaningful relationships. With the INFP I clicked almost instantly which was surprising for me."", ""As far as rationals...I once dated an ENTP, and what I think was an an ESTJ, and fell for an ISTJ who I wanted to pursue something with... but we eventually just became friends. The ENTP was my best relationship. But, there were a few flaws. 1)Her Ne was so strong she was incredibly capricious. And 2) was that she avoided emotional intimacy. I thought that was part of her type but later on she told me it was due to baggage / personal issues. And atually, some of her capriciousness was also probably due to avoidance of intimacy. Otherwise, we were on the same page with so many things, it was a very natural fluid relationship where I could totally be myself. We could talk about ideas for hours. Would definitely be interested in this type again.\n\nThe ESTJ, - Pro's she would have deepish discussions, liked logic. Cons - not emotionally supportive, a bit too judgemental, too concerned with 'S' type matters for my taste. But that might have been more due to the individual and not the type. That being said, I could possibly see myself working with this type if they were mature / well rounded... and leaned a bit more N.\n\nI fell for an ISTJ once... who was a bit more in the middle on some things. It made them more adventurous, introverted, but very social.....a bit more N, and a bit more emotionally supportive than the typical ISTJ stereotype. We got along surprisingly well, she wasn't scared off by deeper conversations... and we bonded over logic. Never got off the ground, but I could see myself possibly dating some sort of ISTJ / ESTJ hyrbid if they were in the middle on certain things / leaned more N, were mature / well rounded etc. Basically an exception, lol... but not totally off the table either."", '(i)NF(x)s are probably my favorites too but it\'s kind of a love/hate relationship. They are usually airy and fun but, willing and capable of having deeper conversations as well. The ones I\'ve met never seem to say what they mean or want though as if they want you to figure it out and that annoys me. In fact I believe it is this type who loves to use the ""Well, you should know"" reasoning when you try to have a discussion about their emotional needs in the relationship. They seem to be more concerned with being nice than being genuine and also seem to assume I am silently judging them which is again annoying!\n\nSJs usually come off as incredibly judgemental to me. The ones I\'ve met love to gossip and belittle others. They also seem to like to play the victim a lot. I don\'t believe I\'ve met any healthy/ mature SJs though to be fair.\n\nThe ESTJ profile sounds the closest to ideal for me personally. According to the profile they seem firmly grounded, responsible, direct as well as confident and decisive. If I could find one that wasn\'t extremly traditonal or stubborn we could probably balance each other out nicely and learn from each other.', ""ESFJ - I was at a party once where the hostess outgoing and a little flirtatious. Not with me mind you, but something about the warm, infectious smile. She made certain that the finger food kept flowing, everyone had a drink and was diligent about it.

91,129,Realistic long term relationships,"['Never mind.', ""Sorry if I don't answer everything specifically, I tend to ramble on for my own benefit.\nGood question, this is something I've been thinking about lately. I think using your mind to pick a partner who has good things to offer over the long term is the best way. Some of those more passionate sparks have a way of burning out. But some don't if the aims of the two coincide and they can work together towards something. E'ryone has to decide for themselves ultimately. As long as you don't end up one of those old people with the empty or angry look in their eye, I think you must've done well for yourself.\nThere seems to be more people that I could have feelings for, then there are people who can satisfy my desire for eclectic intellectual experience and common sensity. So aiming for taking care of the mental/practical side of things, I think that the feeling side could also follow and potentially become even stronger over time if you really work well with someone.\n\nA person might go for a wounded mate for different reasons. Maybe they'd rather be around someone who wont challenge them to break out of their own unhealthy patterns. Maybe they like to feel in control, be able to predict the other person's actions, or feel like a super hero or important/useful.\nI myself used to be a lot more wounded. It's very difficult for a wounded person to maintain a balanced relationship with a healthy person, so how could I have expected to bag someone with their act together? That kind of thinking actually caused me to impose isolation from romance for a long time.\n\nI have to be really careful about entering relationships because I've found that the sex drive can trick my mind about liking someone, only to find out after the act that I was going into it with unconsciously selective perception, temporarily ignoring what I didn't like about someone. (ladies take note)\n\nSo basically I'm still immature and have somewhat of an itch to explore different scenarios and types of people, and sex, but also compartmentally long term relationship minded as well and always have been. This split is beautifully illustrated by the two nearly polar opposite females that I've been talking to now and then. One is a shy young 9.9999 spaz (ISFP?)whose smile can give me a jolt, and the other an INTJ (a seemingly practical choice) a few years older than me.\nSo I'm just sitting back and watching this whole hormonal drive/lifemate polar scale balance itself out, cause I would like to grow up. Just wait for it. ..Aaaany time now."", ""I think it's important to have that spark/physical attraction to your partner and to have common interests & goals. Otherwise you end up settling. I believe the energy you put out tends to be the energy you attract. When I was emotionally unhealthy I attracted men who were also unhealthy or who wanted to fix or save me. I never wanted a savior but rather an equal whom I can trust, love, share, & grow with. Someone who could help keep me focused & grounded & complement my personality. I've been with an ENTJ for 3+ incredible yrs. Everyday is an adventure! I'm glad I didn't pick the first person who would have been a suitable mate or I'd probably be in an unfulfilling marriage with an ESTJ. I'm not sure that pragmatism is a good idea when it comes to matters of the heart."", ""Ya know what, after the events of today I'm starting to see that full blown pragmatism is not exactly the best way to go about these matters. Discernment is a useful tool, as in determining where the other person sees themself in 10, 20 years and what they want to do. Does your life plan match up? Are they angry at men? Do you have an instant connection? Are there never ending supplies of things to talk or interact about? really lining up with a person will catalyze a lot of sharing of ideas and such.\nThat kind of thing seems to be more important in the long run than overly focusing on intelligence like I have a tendency to want to do. Thanks for asking that question."", ""From one INTP to another... don't over analyze yourself. Just because we're good at it with others doesn't mean we're good at it with ourselves. If you are falling for someone, I think the idea is to run with it and let it play out. INTPs are the least forgiving of themselves, from what I can tell. We will get this idea of something in our head and try to make it real.\n\nSeek out who you are attracted to and learn to forgive yourself IF it doesn't work out. That's the healthy route. Also, pidgeon holing yourself by your personality type probably isn't wise. Use sites like this to search for similar or interesting minds. Do not internalize.""]","['Rationals', 'INTP - Architect', 'Personality']",INTP - Architect
92,130,Giving off an untouchable vibe,"['So I\'ve never been on a date or had a boyfriend.\nI feel like I\'m a generally awesome person ;P\nSo what\'s up?\n\nI\'ve asked my family & friends and it seems that I give off an ""untouchable"" vibe or something. It was interesting to find a similar description when I took the instinct test on here.\nWith my primary instinct being sexual (does anyone else feel uncomfy w/that word?), it says that while some are seductive others give off an untouchable aura. Me!\n\nAnyone else in the same boat? Is there anything we could or even should do or will that vibe suddenly ""turn off"" when Mr. or Ms. right comes along?', ""I'd hate to let instinctual variants pigeon hole someone. The best part about the MBTI or any typology I've found is that it lets me know that I am normal and that I am capable of building on my strengths.\n\nHere's a few thoughts to think about:\n\n1) Focus on the negative and you find the negative, focus on the positive and you find the positive.\n\n(That's more than a cute thing to say, its got roots in psychology. Like the example, 'look around your room and count all the red things you see.' Look away, now list all the blue things you saw. Typically respondents will report fewer blue things than if they were asked to focus on looking for blue.)\n\n2) Comfort with the outside world comes from being comfortable with yourself.\n\nAlso, you've never been on a date you say. Have you ever asked someone out on a date? It might be easy to overlook something as simple as that if you have certain expectations as to how a date should go down (i.e., a guy should have to ask the woman out). I looked at your profile and you are an attractive girl, the fact you admit what you've said in your post is a good step towards self-mastery.\n\nThe easiest way to turn off that vibe is probably to own it. Think to yourself 'I might be untouchable, but that also makes me these things from the description (They often have a naturally seductive, sexual charisma that manifests as a fantastical, erotic playfulness)' Combine untouchable and those other things and you now have an intriguing challenge, which, some guys might enjoy."", 'You\'re not the only person. I\'ve actually been told the same thing. Untouchable, or I inadvertently turn people away. And while I\'ve gone on dates, I\'ve never been in a serious relationship.\n\nI think it\'s not all variant based though, some may be based from your functions. For one, I take a while to warm up and feel comfortable opening up to people due to my Introversion, and that often comes off as cold or untouchable. I figure there are people that are willing to work to get to know me and that is fine.\nAlso, I have what I term, ""chronic bitch face"" where I will be deep in thought and I look pissed off. Apparently that is not the easiest to break the ice with, or I\'ve been told anyways.\n\nLike kmaco said, now that you are aware of it, it is something that you are capable of integrating and building upon.\n\nI\'ve gotten to the point where I have to make myself focus on the present moment when I am meeting new people or in an unfamiliar environment, not jumping to what\'s happening tomorrow or what I need to get done for class next week. I try to stay engaged in the situation, or me it\'s picking up on nuances about the person or the surroundings or creating images of the words itself (depending on the situation.) And as much as I have issues with it, it\'s making physical contact with people, touching an arm, brushing hands, etc. That is what I have been working with and it might sound dumb, but it seems to create more accessibility between people and makes us seem less untouchable.\n\nIf you are comfortable and confident with yourself, it\'ll shine through and people will take notice and those that want to get to know you won\'t shy away at that thought of an ""untouchable aura.""', 'Mehoui-\n\nI have that issue with my facial expression too! I tend to look ""disgusted"" when I\'m really just thinking or staring into space. I\'ve been working on it but I often forget. Oi!\n\nAnd I think what you\'re doing to try to seem less ""untouchable"" and more connected and friendly isn\'t dumb at all. It\'s great!', 'I\'ve been told as well that I sometimes give off an ""untouchable"" vibe. Really I just sometimes get lost in my head and also I\'m an introvert. I think just going out and exposing yourself to people, and maybe even a drink or two ;), may expose you to guys that won\'t see you in that light. Inside I\'m quite the opposite but am selective about who gets to see the real me. I also find the process of meeting a new person and getting to know them sometimes uncomfortable as I feel fine in my own little world.\n\nYou are very attractive... I say just go out and try to start with meeting ppl! The other part happens or it doesn\'t. I\'ve never dated someone that it didn\'t feel natural that we do so.', 'I\'m not sure about ""untouchable"" vibe but I give an aloof vibe or stand-offish. I\'m leery when meeting someone for the first time but I warm up if it\'s a person I feel worthy enough to know. I don\'t mean to sound like I\'m elitist (maybe I am) but it\'s more about wanting the right types of people in my life. I\'m choosey who I want to get close to and I won\'t apologize for that. I\'m about quality and not quantity and I think many of the NTs and NFs are drawn to that.\n\nYou\'ll find when you meet someone that ""gets you"" that you\'ll blossom so don\'t allow that to stop you.', ""I easily give off an untouchable vibe not just when I'm uncomfortable around people I dislike, but when I feel vulnerable around someone I really like! So I know how frustrating it can be to have your motives constantly misread. I've had to accept that it takes time for me to warm up to new people, and there has to be obvious interest/chemistry for me to reciprocate warmth. If a guy isn't making the first move, I'll cling protectively to my walls, careful not to come across overly friendly. I can only reassure myself that if someone writes off my introversion as standoffish, they're probably not making the effort with me either. It's likely that you aren't miss untouchable around those who bring out your fullest, most open and authentic self.\n\nI used to be skeptical of the law of attraction, but I think there's some grain of truth in how we tend to get back what we put out. So if we want people to notice and be friendly towards us, we need to become more conscious of our mirroring patterns, and work on deliberately expressing ourselves in accordance with our intentions."", 'I\'ve never been in a serious and/or long term relationship either. I don\'t give off an untouchable vibe either. Years later, I still have some guys admit to me that they wanted to get into my pants, even with the whole tomboy look and attitude. I easily sense and dismiss most jerks, but have never gotten a quality guy who\'s also interested in me, and we connect. So there is men I connect with but he\'s not interested in me, or men who\'s interested in me but I don\'t connect with. I try not to waste my time and I do look around quite a bit, but I haven\'t found it ever. I\'m 27 years old and have been chasing boys/guys since I was in preschool. I even remember my first crush. So for all that is said above that sounds anything remotely like ""the law of attraction"" I call bullshit on.', ""I've been told I give off this vibe as well. I like to keep people at a distance so its not totally unwarranted :p"", '[Also, I have what I term, ""chronic bitch face"" where I will be deep in thought and I look pissed off.]\n\nI have the same problem, whenever I\'m off elsewhere in my mind my face locks in this emotionless mold like a statue, it doesn\'t help at all that I have the squinty Chinese eyes so I get tense moments when my view connects with someone else it looks like I\'m giving them the stink eye, even though I\'m pretty much detached from whatever I\'m seeing in the real world. It makes for extremely awkward and sometimes hostile situations followed by apologies and my train of thought broken for something I am not aware that I was apparently doing. I learned to just stare down at the floor or the ceiling to prevent my eyes from making contact with someone else in case they get the wrong idea, I\'m not trying to be rude or giving them the evil stare down; I\'m just lost in thought.\n\nFor the most part I have to fake a smile which seems to work on making it less threatening, but I have to constantly think about it and force my muscle to grin in public or again stare down to the floor away from eye level.', ""I give off that vibe. I've learned to imitate facial expressions and body language. It takes time to learn but eventually it becomes habit."", '', '', 'The word I\'ve gotten is ""unapproachable"". Some 8 years ago at a young professionals training conference in Denmark so it\'s been some time since then.\n\nTruth be told, at that time in my life I had a perpetual feeling of being \'the other\', I didn\'t feel I belonged anywhere so it\'s no wonder my feelings seeped out and others could sense it.\n\nkmaco makes some excellent points, it all starts from within. If you are comfortable, relaxed and still inside, people who are able to relate with that will naturally gravitate to you.', 'I love my untouchable vibe. The people that will fight through it are usually the best of people. And yes they have to fight through it. You have to earn talking to me.', 'I can sometimes seem angry as well, and I tend to have a ""untouchable aura"". Its really difficult being an INFP ontop of it.\n\nPeople tend to keep back so i get...persisent in response and.... well... an INFP that is seriously focused is hard to get along with...\n\nI tend to say positive reinforcements and focus on good things, and learning new things. I am always seeking new people and friendships.\n\nPassion overcomes the pain, insight and awareness built by research like this site, goes a long way with integrating feedback.\n\n...oh dear...my INFP is showing....dont mind me...im not as egotisical i sound i do care!\n\n', ""I tend to come off as very mellow and maybe even dissinterested. It results in me having to initiate pretty much all social interaction, which is pretty exhausting honestly.\nPeople do usually respond possitively and, if it's a female I'm interested in, she innevitably starts telling me about her boyfriend who she can't live without, but who she doesn't seem to like very much.\n*shakes head*"", ""Pretty sure have that vibe as well, I'm very confident in being quite and minding my own business. In a guy many people take that vibe as confidence, and in a way it is.\n\nSo I've just learned to be the outgoing one, sure I'm an Introvert, but that doesn't mean I don't like people so use all my TJ function to analyze it and my N make it happen (intuit how to strike up a conversation). A beer or two doesn't hurt the N.\n\nI've found people are very responsive, maybe because they thought I was arrogant."", 'I don\'t know if anyone else have realized this, but generally speaking any ""IN""s will have these shared responses. The combination of Introversion and Intuitiveness is a maelstrom of common misconception and understanding. Intuition will, if allowed, continually feed the Introversion creating the ""vibe"" of untouchable or haughtiness. One could say it\'s a natural lack of empathy but in reality it\'s a process of the mind that is constantly asking in the subconsciousness 1.) How does this relate to me? and 2.) How should I respond (to the outside stimuli)? I hope this helps, message me if you want to talk more about it.', 'I relate to a lot of the posts in this forum! I find that I am often approached by men who are clearly attracted to me, and it immediately makes me want to run away. But by the time I feel comfortable with a man I\'ve gotten to know, I think I\'ve already given off too many ""I\'m not interested"" vibes, and so it seems that men rarely ever ask me out. And I also seem to have the mad, or sad look when I\'m really just being pensive.\n\nI\'ve recently started taking dancing lessons, and I feel like it is helping me to let my guard down some, and allow myself to let the more sensual side of me show. Still learning though.', 'Update:\n\nI decided to consciously ""turn on"" the touchable vibe in 2015 & got super results!\nFirst kiss, first date, first other things ;)\n\nJust being conscious about it and consciously not putting up (and even consciously taking down) a wall around guys helped a lot.', 'A friend once told me that my clothes gave the impression ""come over here, but don\'t get too close"". I was dressing to compliment my body, but with a bit of an edge, so her appraisal was accurate but it didn\'t occur to me that I might be keeping people away. Later I adjusted my wardrobe to softer styles, but it just wasn\'t me. Now I don\'t really care about others\' opinions and just dress fabulous!\n\nIt has been a benefit on several occasions, though. My demeanor helps me maintain separate work and personal lives. The untouchable quality can be useful in certain leadership positions. Aloofness has kept away unwanted solicitations.\n\nThere was one issue with a low-level manager at work who took it as arrogance; I suspect it was her insecurity working on her, though. I finally realized that as a manager she should have managed her own reactions - instead I had been trying to manage her insecurity!!!', '', '', 'I give off this vibe as well. A sort of ""don\'t get too close"" look. I\'ve been told that for me it appears I\'m aloof, upset or irritated.\n\nI took an acting class and the untouchable vibe turned off there, but it comes back in most situations.\n\nThanks to everyone for there posts about this. Glad to know i\'m not the only one.', ""It's more of an elusive vibe, rather than untouchable. My guy friends have told me I seem elusive or they were intimidated by me before they really got to know me. I think it's just hard for guys to approach a girl who seems really closed off, and who isn't flirting with them and validating them.

94,132,Must Read List,"[""Hi everyone, I asked what are some essential reads not too long ago and then I realized I should have asked it on the forums. Well anyway here is the list so far.\nvinc recommended\nNietzsche - The Birth of a Tragedy\nMises - Human Action\nMencken - Notes on Democracy\nHayek - The Road to Serfdom\nNewton - The Principia (give this book time, it's worth it!)\niLove recommended\nTao Te Ching,\nChuang Tzu\nthe original Buddhist scripts\nPeople's Hist of United States or something similar\nSomething like Think and Grow Rich about the power of the mind\nEverything that calls to you\nSomething for survival and foraging\nSomething about how to properly have sex. Tao of Sexology is ok.\nSynergistic Power\nAll the science you can stomach\nEast and West\nI recommend\nThe Art of War\nThe Art of Peace\nAnything H.P. Lovecraft (Sounds Cliche but there is some deep tones and feelings in his writing. You can really feel what hardships he was going through through his writing even if the story was about tentacle monsters)\nMein Kampf (Really odd insight into the mind of one of history's most hated dictator)"", ""I'd recommend Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, for women and men."", ""The City of Dreaming Books by Walter Moers\nfor anyone who is a total book lover and/or likes pictures in books\n\nThe curious incident of a dog in the night time by Mark Haddon\nfor anyone interested in autistic/Aspergerian behavior or dead dogs\n\nThe Bible\nAll of it for everyone, but especially\nif you can't get to sleep; Numbers\nif you like to read song lyrics and poems; Psalms\nif you like Kafka/Nietsche; Ecclesiastes\nif you like sci-fi; Revelation\n\nShort History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson\n\nSomething by Terry Pratchett\n\nAnd everything by Roald Dahl."", ""LMAO @ 'if you can't get to sleep; Numbers'"", '-The Language of Emotions ?“Karla McLaren\n-The Art of Empathy ?“Karla McLaren\n-Facets of Unity ?“A.H Almaas (If you?™re curious what the Enneagram entails.)', 'Sigh, that was an understatement.

95,133,Open Discussion for Men and Women - Relationship/Misc Life,"[""This is a copy of the bulletin I posted on craigslist to form a new group. You are allowed to talk about this club. What do you think? Would you attend if you lived in southern oregon?\nWhat would you want to share with people? What would you want to get advice on/analyze with others?\n---\nI would like to start a group composed by people with the desire to share/learn from their own experience as well as the experience/perspectives of others; mainly about what people believe it is to be a Man and what it is to be a Woman, synergistic power, self-knowledge, and love. This is designed to help those participating to increase their understanding of themselves: what they are, what they want, and to cut away unhealthy patterns, thereby empowering an individual to come into their own power in situations, attract and create who/what they need, repel what they don't, and feel no shame in doing so.\nI want to structure this similar to the way NA does things, with no hierarchy other than a moderator; except that I would like to see it be more of a discussion where ideas could be examined in depth. I'm very open and discerning to reasonable suggestions.\n\nEach meeting could have a basic topic just to get the ball rolling, but I don't mind changes in subject as long as it's relevant.\nExample topics:\nWhere and if people draw lines in their own masculinity/femininity.\nHow young people can avoid getting abused/knocked up/gamed by older people\nCultural influences on sexuality and gender identity\nCultural influences in general\nHuman instinct, needs, wants\nReality\n\nI have no official experience in creating and moderating a group like this. I do have experience examining topics that interest me in detail, with whoever has the time and desire to discuss. I'm an ISTP with a strong Ni and Fi bend who's turned his mechanical gear-shaped mind onto the fields of self-exploration, limit breaking, fear extinguishing, humanity, and social/economic systems.\n\nThere are no rules other than respect for both the law of the wild and the law of love.\nYes, you may talk about this club."", ""On craigslist? They're going to think you're starting a cult :P\n\nThis is pure speculation but you need to ask yourself how many people would even be interested in introspection at this deep level? We live in a high paced, high stimulus environment. We don't want to know what it means to be a man, culture already tells us being a man is making tons of money and having 2.5 kids. There are even those who would argue the entire notion of masculinity or femininity itself is an entirely culturally based phenomenon and does not exist separate from culture.\n\nI think its a sound idea, but, you target a very limited scope of individuals! (I could be wrong about this of course). A really good place to find those with interest on the topic might be creating a forum where discussion could start."", ""These http://www.truereligion-outlet.com.co/ she http://www.uggs-onsale.net/

96,134,"The Extraverted Feeling Type - Jung, Psychological Types","['""4. The Extraverted Feeling-Type\n\nIn so far as feeling is, incontestably, a more obvious peculiarity of feminine psychology than thinking, the most pronounced feeling-types are also to be found among women. When extraverted feeling possesses the priority we speak of an extraverted feeling-type. Examples of this type that I can call to mind are, almost without exception, women. She is a woman who follows the guiding-line of her feeling. As the result of education her feeling has become developed into an adjusted function, subject to conscious control. Except in extreme cases, feeling has a personal character, in spite of the fact that the subjective factor may be already, to a large extent, repressed. The personality appears to be adjusted in relation to objective conditions. Her feelings correspond with objective situations and general values. Nowhere is this more clearly revealed than in the so-called \'love-choice\'; the \'suitable\' man is loved, not another one; he is suitable not so much because he fully accords with the fundamental character of the woman -- as a rule she is quite uninformed about this -- but because [p. 449] he meticulously corresponds in standing, age, capacity, height, and family respectability with every reasonable requirement. Such a formulation might, of course, be easily rejected as ironical or depreciatory, were I not fully convinced that the love-feeling of this type of woman completely corresponds with her choice. It is genuine, and not merely intelligently manufactured. Such \'reasonable\' marriages exist without number, and they are by no means the worst. Such women are good comrades to their husbands and excellent mothers, so long as husbands or children possess the conventional psychic constitution. One can feel \'correctly\', however, only when feeling is disturbed by nothing else. But nothing disturbs feeling so much as thinking. It is at once intelligible, therefore, that this type should repress thinking as much as possible. This does not mean to say that such a woman does not think at all; on the contrary, she may even think a great deal and very ably, but her thinking is never sui generis; it is, in fact, an Epimethean appendage to her feeling. What she cannot feel, she cannot consciously think. \'But I can\'t think what I don\'t feel\', such a type said to me once in indignant tones. As far as feeling permits, she can think very well, but every conclusion, however logical, that might lead to a disturbance of feeling is rejected from the outset. It is simply not thought. And thus everything that corresponds with objective valuations is good: these things are loved or treasured; the rest seems merely to exist in a world apart.\n\nBut a change comes over the picture when the importance of the object reaches a still higher level. As already explained above, such an assimilation of subject to object then occurs as almost completely to engulf the subject of feeling. Feeling loses its personal character -- it becomes feeling per se; it almost seems as though the [p. 450] personality were wholly dissolved in the feeling of the moment. Now, since in actual life situations constantly and successively alternate, in which the feeling-tones released are not only different but are actually mutually contrasting, the personality inevitably becomes dissipated in just so many different feelings. Apparently, he is this one moment, and something completely different the next -- apparently, I repeat, for in reality such a manifold personality is altogether impossible. The basis of the ego always remains identical with itself, and, therefore, appears definitely opposed to the changing states of feeling. Accordingly the observer senses the display of feeling not so much as a personal expression of the feeling-subject as an alteration of his ego, a mood, in other words. Corresponding with the degree of dissociation between the ego and the momentary state of feeling, signs of disunion with the self will become more or less evident, i.e. the original compensatory attitude of the unconscious becomes a manifest opposition. This reveals itself, in the first instance, in extravagant demonstrations of feeling, in loud and obtrusive feeling predicates, which leave one, however, somewhat incredulous. They ring hollow; they are not convincing. On the contrary, they at once give one an inkling of a resistance that is being overcompensated, and one begins to wonder whether such a feeling-judgment might not just as well be entirely different. In fact, in a very short time it actually is different. Only a very slight alteration in the situation is needed to provoke forthwith an entirely contrary estimation of the selfsame object. The result of such an experience is that the observer is unable to take either judgment at all seriously. He begins to reserve his own opinion. But since, with this type, it is a matter of the greatest moment to establish an intensive feeling rapport with his environment, redoubled efforts are now required [p. 451] to overcome this reserve. Thus, in the manner of the circulus vitiosus, the situation goes from bad to worse. The more the feeling relation with the object becomes overstressed, the nearer the unconscious opposition approaches the surface.\n\nWe have already seen that the extraverted feeling type, as a rule, represses his thinking, just because thinking is the function most liable to disturb feeling. Similarly, when thinking seeks to arrive at pure results of any kind, its first act is to exclude feeling, since nothing is calculated to harass and falsify thinking so much as feeling-values. Thinking, therefore, in so far as it is an independent function, is repressed in the extraverted feeling type. Its repression, as I observed before, is complete only in so far as its inexorable logic forces it to conclusions that are incompatible with feeling. It is suffered to exist as the servant of feeling, or more accurately its slave. Its backbone is broken; it may not operate on its own account, in accordance with its own laws, Now, since a logic exists producing inexorably right conclusions, this must happen somewhere, although beyond the bounds of consciousness, i.e. in the unconscious. Pre-eminently, therefore, the unconscious content of this type is a particular kind of thinking. It is an infantile, archaic, and negative thinking.\n\nSo long as conscious feeling preserves the personal character, or, in other words, so long as the personality does not become swallowed up by successive states of feeling, this unconscious thinking remains compensatory. But as soon as the personality is dissociated, becoming dispersed in mutually contradictory states of feeling, the identity of the ego is lost, and the subject becomes unconscious. But, because of the subject\'s lapse into the unconscious, it becomes associated with the unconscious thinking -- function, therewith assisting the unconscious [p. 452] thought to occasional consciousness. The stronger the conscious feeling relation, and therefore, the more \'depersonalized,\' it becomes, the stronger grows the unconscious opposition. This reveals itself in the fact that unconscious ideas centre round just the most valued objects, which are thus pitilessly stripped of their value. That thinking which always thinks in the \'nothing but\' style is in its right place here, since it destroys the ascendancy of the feeling that is chained to the object.\n\nUnconscious thought reaches the surface in the form of irruptions, often of an obsessing nature, the general character of which is always negative and depreciatory. Women of this type have moments when the most hideous thoughts fasten upon the very objects most valued by their feelings. This negative thinking avails itself of every infantile prejudice or parallel that is calculated to breed doubt in the feeling-value, and it tows every primitive instinct along with it, in the effort to make \'a nothing but\' interpretation of the feeling. At this point, it is perhaps in the nature of a side-remark to observe that the collective unconscious, i.e. the totality of the primordial images, also becomes enlisted in the same manner, and from the elaboration and development of these images there dawns the possibility of a regeneration of the attitude upon another basis.\n\nHysteria, with the characteristic infantile sexuality of its unconscious world of ideas, is the principal form of neurosis with this type.""\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text.

97,135,"The Extraverted Intuitive Type - Carl Jung, Psychological Types","['""9. The Extraverted Intuitive Type\n\nWhenever intuition predominates, a particular and unmistakable psychology presents itself. Because intuition is orientated by the object, a decided dependence upon external situations is discernible, but it has an altogether different character from the dependence of the sensational type. The intuitive is never to be found among the generally recognized reality values, but he is always present where possibilities exist. He has a keen nose for things in the bud pregnant with future promise. He can never exist in stable, long-established conditions of generally acknowledged though limited value: because his eye is constantly ranging for new possibilities, stable conditions have an air of impending suffocation. He seizes hold of new objects and new ways with eager intensity, sometimes with extraordinary enthusiasm, only to abandon them cold-bloodedly, without regard and apparently without remembrance, as soon as their range becomes clearly defined and a promise of any considerable future development no longer clings to them. As long as a possibility exists, the intuitive is bound to it with thongs of fate. It is as though his whole life went out into the new situation. One gets the impression, which he himself shares, that he has just reached the definitive turning point in his life, and that from now on nothing else can seriously engage his thought and feeling. How- [p. 465] ever reasonable and opportune it may be, and although every conceivable argument speaks in favour of stability, a day will come when nothing will deter him from regarding as a prison, the self-same situation that seemed to promise him freedom and deliverance, and from acting accordingly. Neither reason nor feeling can restrain or discourage him from a new possibility, even though it may run counter to convictions hitherto unquestioned. Thinking and feeling, the indispensable components of conviction, are, with him, inferior functions, possessing no decisive weight; hence they lack the power to offer any lasting. resistance to the force of intuition. And yet these are the only functions that are capable of creating any effectual compensation to the supremacy of intuition, since they can provide the intuitive with that judgment in which his type is altogether lacking. The morality of the intuitive is governed neither by intellect nor by feeling; he has his own characteristic morality, which consists in a loyalty to his intuitive view of things and a voluntary submission to its authority, Consideration for the welfare of his neighbours is weak. No solid argument hinges upon their well-being any more than upon his own. Neither can we detect in him any great respect for his neighbour\'s convictions and customs; in fact, he is not infrequently put down as an immoral and ruthless adventurer. Since his intuition is largely concerned with outer objects, scenting out external possibilities, he readily applies himself to callings wherein he may expand his abilities in many directions. Merchants, contractors, speculators, agents, politicians, etc., commonly belong to this type.\n\nApparently this type is more prone to favour women than men; in which case, however, the intuitive activity reveals itself not so much in the professional as in the social sphere. Such women understand the art of utilizing every social opportunity; they establish right social con- [p. 466] nections; they seek out lovers with possibilities only to abandon everything again for the sake of a new possibility.\n\nIt is at once clear, both from the standpoint of political economy and on grounds of general culture, that such a type is uncommonly important. If well-intentioned, with an orientation to life not purely egoistical, he may render exceptional service as the promoter, if not the initiator of every kind of promising enterprise. He is the natural advocate of every minority that holds the seed of future promise. Because of his capacity, when orientated more towards men than things, to make an intuitive diagnosis of their abilities and range of usefulness, he can also \'make\' men. His capacity to inspire his fellow-men with courage, or to kindle enthusiasm for something new, is unrivalled, although he may have forsworn it by the morrow. The more powerful and vivid his intuition, the more is his subject fused and blended with the divined possibility. He animates it; he presents it in plastic shape and with convincing fire; he almost embodies it. It is not a mere histrionic display, but a fate.\n\nThis attitude has immense dangers -- all too easily the intuitive may squander his life. He spends himself animating men and things, spreading around him an abundance of life -- a life, however, which others live, not he. Were he able to rest with the actual thing, he would gather the fruit of his labours; yet all too soon must he be running after some fresh possibility, quitting his newly planted field, while others reap the harvest. In the end he goes empty away. But when the intuitive lets things reach such a pitch, he also has the unconscious against him. The unconscious of the intuitive has a certain similarity with that of the sensation-type. Thinking and feeling, being relatively repressed, produce infantile and archaic thoughts and feelings in the unconscious, which may be compared [p. 467] with those of the countertype. They likewise come to the surface in the form of intensive projections, and are just as absurd as those of the sensation-type, only to my mind they lack the other\'s mystical character; they are chiefly concerned with quasi-actual things, in the nature of sexual, financial, and other hazards, as, for instance, suspicions of approaching illness. This difference appears to be due to a repression of the sensations of actual things. These latter usually command attention in the shape of a sudden entanglement with a most unsuitable woman, or, in the case of a woman, with a thoroughly unsuitable man; and this is simply the result of their unwitting contact with the sphere of archaic sensations. But its consequence is an unconsciously compelling tie to an object of incontestable futility. Such an event is already a compulsive symptom, which is also thoroughly characteristic of this type. In common with the sensation-type, he claims a similar freedom and exemption from all restraint, since he suffers no submission of his decisions to rational judgment, relying entirely upon the perception of chance, possibilities. He rids himself of the restrictions of reason, only to fall a victim to unconscious neurotic compulsions in the form of oversubtle, negative reasoning, hair-splitting dialectics, and a compulsive tie to the sensation of the object. His conscious attitude, both to the sensation and the sensed object, is one of sovereign superiority and disregard. Not that he means to be inconsiderate or superior -- he simply does not see the object that everyone else sees; his oblivion is similar to that of the sensation-type -- only, with the latter, the soul of the object is missed. For this oblivion the object sooner or later takes revenge in the form of hypochondriacal, compulsive ideas, phobias, and every imaginable kind of absurd bodily sensation.

98,136,"The Introverted Intuitive Type - Carl Jung, Psychological Types","['""9. The Introverted Intuitive Type\n\nThe peculiar nature of introverted intuition, when given the priority, also produces a peculiar type of man, viz. the mystical dreamer and seer on the one hand, or the fantastical crank and artist on the other. The latter might be regarded as the normal case, since there is a general tendency of this type to confine himself to the perceptive character of intuition. As a rule, the intuitive stops at perception; perception is his principal problem, and -- in the case of a productive artist-the shaping of perception. But the crank contents himself with the intuition by which he himself is shaped and determined. Intensification of intuition naturally often results in an extraordinary aloofness of the individual from tangible reality; he may even become a complete enigma to his own immediate circle. [p. 509]\n\nIf an artist, he reveals extraordinary, remote things in his art, which in iridescent profusion embrace both the significant and the banal, the lovely and the grotesque, the whimsical and the sublime. If not an artist, he is frequently an unappreciated genius, a great man \'gone wrong\', a sort of wise simpleton, a figure for \'psychological\' novels.\n\nAlthough it is not altogether in the line of the introverted intuitive type to make of perception a moral problem, since a certain reinforcement of the rational functions is required for this, yet even a relatively slight differentiation of judgment would suffice to transfer intuitive perception from the purely Ã¦sthetic into the moral sphere. A variety of this type is thus produced which differs essentially from its Ã¦sthetic form, although none the less characteristic of the introverted intuitive. The moral problem comes into being when the intuitive tries to relate himself to his vision, when he is no longer satisfied with mere perception and its Ã¦sthetic shaping and estimation, but confronts the question: What does this mean for me and for the world? What emerges from this vision in the way of a duty or task, either for me or for the world? The pure intuitive who represses judgment or possesses it only under the spell of perception never meets this question fundamentally, since his only problem is the How of perception. He, therefore, finds the moral problem unintelligible, even absurd, and as far as possible forbids his thoughts to dwell upon the disconcerting vision. It is different with the morally orientated intuitive. He concerns himself with the meaning of his vision; he troubles less about its further Ã¦sthetic possibilities than about the possible moral effects which emerge from its intrinsic significance. His judgment allows him to discern, though often only darkly, that he, as a man and as a totality, is in some way inter-related with his vision, that [p. 510] it is something which cannot just be perceived but which also would fain become the life of the subject. Through this realization he feels bound to transform his vision into his own life. But, since he tends to rely exclusively upon his vision, his moral effort becomes one-sided; he makes himself and his life symbolic, adapted, it is true, to the inner and eternal meaning of events, but unadapted to the actual present-day reality. Therewith he also deprives himself of any influence upon it, because he remains unintelligible. His language is not that which is commonly spoken -- it becomes too subjective. His argument lacks convincing reason. He can only confess or pronounce. His is the \'voice of one crying in the wilderness\'.\n\nThe introverted intuitive\'s chief repression falls upon the sensation of the object. His unconscious is characterized by this fact. For we find in his unconscious a compensatory extraverted sensation function of an archaic character. The unconscious personality may, therefore, best be described as an extraverted sensation-type of a rather low and primitive order. Impulsiveness and unrestraint are the characters of this sensation, combined with an extraordinary dependence upon the sense impression. This latter quality is a compensation to the thin upper air of the conscious attitude, giving it a certain weight, so that complete \'sublimation\' is prevented. But if, through a forced exaggeration of the conscious attitude, a complete subordination to the inner perception should develop, the unconscious becomes an opposition, giving rise to compulsive sensations whose excessive dependence upon the object is in frank conflict with the conscious attitude. The form of neurosis is a compulsion-neurosis, exhibiting symptoms that are partly hypochondriacal manifestations, partly hypersensibility of the sense organs and partly compulsive ties to definite persons or other objects.

99,137,"The Introverted Feeling Type - Carl Jung, Psychological Types","['""4. The Introverted Feeling Type\n\nIt is principally among women that I have found the priority of introverted feeling. The proverb \'Still waters run deep\' is very true of such women. They are mostly silent, inaccessible, and hard to understand; often they hide behind a childish or banal mask, and not infrequently their temperament is melancholic. They neither shine nor reveal themselves. Since they submit the control of their lives to their subjectively orientated feeling, their true motives generally remain concealed. Their outward demeanour is harmonious and inconspicuous; they reveal a delightful repose, a sympathetic parallelism, which has no desire to affect others, either to impress, influence, or change them in any way. Should this outer side be somewhat emphasized, a suspicion of neglectfulness and coldness may easily obtrude itself, which not seldom increases to a real indifference for the comfort and well-being of others. One distinctly feels the movement of feeling away from the object. With the normal type, however, such an event only occurs when the object has in some way too strong an effect. The harmonious feeling atmosphere rules only so long as the object moves upon its own way with a moderate feeling intensity, and makes no attempt to cross the other\'s path. There is little effort to accompany the real emotions of the object, which tend to be damped and rebuffed, or to put it more aptly, are \'cooled off\' by a negative feeling-judgment. Although one may find a constant readiness for a peaceful and harmonious companionship, the unfamiliar object is shown no touch of amiability, no gleam of responding warmth, but is met by a manner of apparent indifference or repelling coldness. [p. 493]\n\nOne may even be made to feel the superfluousness of one\'s own existence. In the presence of something that might carry one away or arouse enthusiasm, this type observes a benevolent neutrality, tempered with an occasional trace of superiority and criticism that soon takes the wind out of the sails of a sensitive object. But a stormy emotion will be brusquely rejected with murderous coldness, unless it happens to catch the subject from the side of the unconscious, i.e. unless, through the animation of some primordial image, feeling is, as it were, taken captive. In which event such a woman simply feels a momentary laming, invariably producing, in due course, a still more violent resistance, which reaches the object in his most vulnerable spot. The relation to the object is, as far as possible, kept in a secure and tranquil middle state of feeling, where passion and its intemperateness are resolutely proscribed. Expression of feeling, therefore, remains niggardly and, when once aware of it at all, the object has a permanent sense of his undervaluation. Such, however, is not always the case, since very often the deficit remains unconscious; whereupon the unconscious feeling-claims gradually produce symptoms which compel a more serious attention.\n\nA superficial judgment might well be betrayed, by a rather cold and reserved demeanour, into denying all feeling to this type. Such a view, however, would be quite false; the truth is, her feelings are intensive rather than extensive. They develop into the depth. Whereas, for instance, an extensive feeling of sympathy can express itself in both word and deed at the right place, thus quickly ridding itself of its impression, an intensive sympathy, because shut off from every means of expression, gains a passionate depth that embraces the misery of a world and is simply benumbed. It may possibly make an extravagant irruption, leading to some staggering act of an almost heroic character, to which, however, neither the object nor [p. 494] the subject can find a right relation. To the outer world, or to the blind eyes of the extravert, this sympathy looks like coldness, for it does nothing visibly, and an extraverted consciousness is unable to believe in invisible forces.\n\nSuch misunderstanding is a characteristic occurrence in the life of this type, and is commonly registered as a most weighty argument against any deeper feeling relation with the object. But the underlying, real object of this feeling is only dimly divined by the normal type. It may possibly express its aim and content in a concealed religiosity anxiously shielded, from profane eyes, or in intimate poetic forms equally safeguarded from surprise; not without a secret ambition to bring about some superiority over the object by such means. Women often express much of it in their children, letting their passionateness flow secretly into them.\n\nAlthough in the normal type, the tendency, above alluded to, to overpower or coerce the object once openly and visibly with the thing secretly felt, rarely plays a disturbing role, and never leads to a serious attempt in this direction, some trace of it, none the less, leaks through into the personal effect upon the object, in the form of a domineering influence often difficult to define. It is sensed as a sort of stifling or oppressive feeling which holds the immediate circle under a spell. It gives a woman of this type a certain mysterious power that may prove terribly fascinating to the extraverted man, for it touches his unconscious. This power is derived from the deeply felt, unconscious images; consciousness, however, readily refers it to the ego, whereupon the influence becomes debased into personal tyranny. But, wherever the unconscious subject is identified with the ego, the mysterious power of the intensive feeling is also transformed into banal and arrogant ambition, vanity, and [p. 495] petty tyranny. This produces a type of woman most regrettably distinguished by her unscrupulous ambition and mischievous cruelty. But this change in the picture leads also to neurosis.\n\nSo long as the ego feels itself housed, as it were, beneath the heights of the unconscious subject, and feeling reveals something higher and mightier than the ego, the type is normal. The unconscious thinking is certainly archaic, yet its reductions may prove extremely helpful in compensating the occasional inclinations to exalt the ego into the subject. But, whenever this does take place by dint of complete suppression of the unconscious reductive thinking-products, the unconscious thinking goes over into opposition and becomes projected into objects. Whereupon the now egocentric subject comes to feel the power and importance of the depreciated object. Consciousness begins to feel \'what others think\'. Naturally, others are thinking, all sorts of baseness, scheming evil, and contriving all sorts of plots, secret intrigues, etc. To prevent this, the subject must also begin to carry out preventive intrigues, to suspect and sound others, to make subtle combinations. Assailed by rumours, he must make convulsive efforts to convert, if possible, a threatened inferiority into a superiority. Innumerable secret rivalries develop, and in these embittered struggles not only will no base or evil means be disdained, but even virtues will be misused and tampered with in order to play the trump card. Such a development must lead to exhaustion. The form of neurosis is neurasthenic rather than hysterical; in the case of women we often find severe collateral physical states, as for instance anÃ¦mia and its sequelÃ¦.""\n\n\nStraight out of Jung\'s book on Psychological Types.', ""This passage stops me from reading any more Jung.\n\nIt is such a flat description of Fi and so focused on the negative. I don't know if it was supposed to be a Fi-Ne combination but I think it is just a depiction of what can go wrong with Fi rather than a full well rounded description. Then again strong introversion is different from a more extroverted form of it.\n\nThe frustrating part is that commenting on how negative it is can be seen as a Fi reaction :l\n\nSo- I am not using any Fi for this comment- I syphoned it off and I am running on a Ne-Te combination right now."", ""I suppose I see what you're getting at that he's criticizing but maybe he's highlighting the negatives because of the angle he's approaching the situation from - that is to say as a psychiatrist and later psychologist? And in those days there was a focus on mental illness; as opposed to nowadays with the Positive Psychology movement and focusing on studying healthy individuals and their life-affirming traits.\n\nPlus if you think this is mean you should read the passages he wrote on the sensing types; I'm pretty sure at one point he remarked they have no soul! Maybe it was they seem like they have no soul, don't remember - regardless is wasn't particularly nice. To be fair though, Jung was self-admittedly an introverted intuition type, so in terms of his theories it'd make sense he'd be more likely to be mean with those of his inferior function.\n\n""]","['Romantics ', 'Personality', 'INFP - Healer']",INFP - Healer
100,138,"The Extraverted Sensing Type - Carl Jung, Psychological Types","['""7. The Extraverted Sensation Type\n\nNo other human type can equal the extraverted sensation-type in realism. His sense for objective facts is extraordinarily developed. His life is an accumulation of actual experience with concrete objects, and the more pronounced he is, the less use does he make of his experience. In certain cases the events of his life hardly deserve [p. 458] the name \'experience\'. He knows no better use for this sensed \'experience\' than to make it serve as a guide to fresh sensations; anything in the least \'new\' that comes within his circle of interest is forthwith turned to a sensational account and is made to serve this end. In so far as one is disposed to regard a highly developed sense for sheer actuality as very reasonable, will such men be esteemed rational. In reality, however, this is by no means the case, since they are equally subject to the sensation of irrational, chance happenings, as they are to rational behaviour.\n\nSuch a type -- the majority arc men apparently -- does not, of course, believe himself to be \'subject\' to sensation. He would be much more inclined to ridicule this view as altogether inconclusive, since, from his standpoint, sensation is the concrete manifestation of life -- it is simply the fulness [sic] of actual living. His aim is concrete enjoyment, and his morality is similarly orientated. For true enjoyment has its own special morality, its own moderation and lawfulness, its own unselfishness and devotedness. It by no means follows that he is just sensual or gross, for he may differentiate his sensation to the finest pitch of Ã¦sthetic purity without being the least unfaithful, even in his most abstract sensations, to his principle of objective sensation. Wulfen\'s Cicerone des r&uml;cksichtlosen Lebensgenusses is the unvarnished confession of a type of this sort. From this point of view the book seems to me worth reading.\n\nUpon the lower levels this is the man of tangible reality, with little tendency either for reflection or commanding purpose. To sense the object, to have and if possible to enjoy sensations, is his constant motive. He is by no means unlovable; on the contrary, he frequently has a charming and lively capacity for enjoyment; he is sometimes a jolly fellow, and often a refined Ã¦sthete. [p. 459]\n\nIn the former case, the great problems of life hinge upon a good or indifferent dinner; in the latter, they are questions of good taste. When he \'senses\', everything essential has been said and done. Nothing can be more than concrete and actual; conjectures that transcend or go beyond the concrete are only permitted on condition that they enhance sensation. This need not be in any way a pleasurable reinforcement, since this type is not a common voluptuary; he merely desires the strongest sensation, and this, by his very nature, he can receive only from without. What comes from within seems to him morbid and objectionable. In so far as lie thinks and feels, he always reduces down to objective foundations, i.e. to influences coming from the object, quite unperturbed by the most violent departures from logic. Tangible reality, under any conditions, makes him breathe again. In this respect he is unexpectedly credulous. He will, without hesitation, relate an obvious psychogenic symptom to the falling barometer, while the existence of a psychic conflict seems to him a fantastic abnormality. His love is incontestably rooted in the manifest attractions of the object. In so far as he is normal, he is conspicuously adjusted to positive reality -- conspicuously, because his adjustment is always visible. His ideal is the actual; in this respect he is considerate. He has no ideals related to ideas -- he has, therefore, no sort of ground for maintaining a hostile attitude towards the reality of things and facts. This expresses itself in all the externals of his life. He dresses well, according to his circumstances ; he keeps a good table for his friends, who are either made comfortable or at least given to understand that his fastidious taste is obliged to impose certain claims upon his entourage. He even convinces one that certain sacrifices are decidedly worth while for the sake of style.\n\nBut the more sensation predominates, so that the [p. 460] sensing subject disappears behind the sensation, the more unsatisfactory does this type become. Either he develops into a crude pleasure-seeker or he becomes an unscrupulous, designing sybarite. Although the object is entirely indispensable to him, yet, as something existing in and through itself, it is none the less depreciated. It is ruthlessly violated and essentially ignored, since now its sole use is to stimulate sensation. The hold upon the object is pushed to the utmost limit. The unconscious is, accordingly, forced out of its me[accent]tier as a compensatory function and driven into open opposition. But, above all, the repressed intuitions begin to assert themselves in the form of projections upon the object. The strangest conjectures arise; in the case of a sexual object, jealous phantasies and anxiety-states play a great role. More acute cases develop every sort of phobia, and especially compulsive symptoms. The pathological contents have a remarkable air of unreality, with a frequent moral or religious colouring. A pettifogging captiousness often develops, or an absurdly scrupulous morality coupled with a primitive, superstitious and \'magical\' religiosity, harking back to abstruse rites. All these things have their source in the repressed inferior functions, which, in such cases, stand in harsh opposition to the conscious standpoint; they wear, in fact, an aspect that is all the more striking because they appear to rest upon the most absurd suppositions, in complete contrast to the conscious sense of reality. The whole culture of thought and feeling seems, in this second personality, to be twisted into a morbid primitiveness; reason is hair-splitting sophistry -- morality is dreary moralizing and palpable Pharisaism -- religion is absurd superstition -- intuition, the noblest of human gifts, is a mere personal subtlety, a sniffing into every corner; instead of searching the horizon, it recedes to the narrowest gauge of human meanness. [p. 461]\n\nThe specially compulsive character of the neurotic symptoms represent the unconscious counterweight to the laisser aller morality of a purely sensational attitude, which, from the standpoint of rational judgment, accepts without discrimination, everything that happens. Although this lack of basic principles in the sensation-type does not argue an absolute lawlessness and lack of restraint, it at least deprives him of the quite essential restraining power of judgment. Rational judgment represents a conscious coercion, which the rational type appears to impose upon himself of his own free will. This compulsion overtakes the sensation-type from the unconscious. Moreover, the rational type\'s link to the object, from the very existence of a judgment, never means such an unconditioned relation as that which the sensation-type has with the object. When his attitude reaches an abnormal one-sidedness, he is in danger of falling just as deeply into the arms of the unconscious as he consciously clings to the object. When he becomes neurotic, he is much harder to treat in the rational way, because the functions to which the physician must appeal are in a relatively undifferentiated state; hence little or no trust can be placed in them. Special means of bringing emotional pressure to bear are often needed to make him at all conscious.""\n\n',

101,139,"The Introverted Thinking Type - Carl Jung, Psychological Types","['""2. The Introverted Thinking Type\n\nJust as Darwin might possibly represent the normal extraverted thinking type, so we might point to Kant as a counter-example of the normal introverted thinking type. The former speaks with facts; the latter appeals to the subjective factor. Darwin ranges over the wide fields of objective facts, while Kant restricts himself to a critique of knowledge in general. But suppose a Cuvier be contrasted with a Nietzsche: the antithesis becomes even sharper.\n\nThe introverted thinking type is characterized by a priority of the thinking I have just described. Like his [p. 485] extraverted parallel, he is decisively influenced by ideas; these, however, have their origin, not in the objective data but in the subjective foundation. Like the extravert, he too will follow his ideas, but in the reverse direction: inwardly not outwardly. Intensity is his aim, not extensity. In these fundamental characters he differs markedly, indeed quite unmistakably from his extraverted parallel. Like every introverted type, he is almost completely lacking in that which distinguishes his counter type, namely, the intensive relatedness to the object. In the case of a human object, the man has a distinct feeling that he matters only in a negative way, i.e., in milder instances he is merely conscious of being superfluous, but with a more extreme type he feels himself warded off as something definitely disturbing. This negative relation to the object-indifference, and even aversion-characterizes every introvert; it also makes a description of the introverted type in general extremely difficult. With him, everything tends to disappear and get concealed. His judgment appears cold, obstinate, arbitrary, and inconsiderate, simply because he is related less to the object than the subject. One can feel nothing in it that might possibly confer a higher value upon the object; it always seems to go beyond the object, leaving behind it a flavour of a certain subjective superiority. Courtesy, amiability, and friendliness may be present, but often with a particular quality suggesting a certain uneasiness, which betrays an ulterior aim, namely, the disarming of an opponent, who must at all costs be pacified and set at ease lest he prove a disturbing- element. In no sense, of course, is he an opponent, but, if at all sensitive, he will feel somewhat repelled, perhaps even depreciated. Invariably the object has to submit to a certain neglect; in worse cases it is even surrounded with quite unnecessary measures of precaution. Thus it happens that this type tends to [p. 486]\n\ndisappear behind a cloud of misunderstanding, which only thickens the more he attempts to assume, by way of compensation and with the help of his inferior functions, a certain mask of urbanity, which often presents a most vivid contrast to his real nature. Although in the extension of his world of ideas he shrinks from no risk, however daring, and never even considers the possibility that such a world might also be dangerous, revolutionary, heretical, and wounding to feeling, he is none the less a prey to the liveliest anxiety, should it ever chance to become objectively real. That goes against the grain. When the time comes for him to transplant his ideas into the world, his is by no means the air of an anxious mother solicitous for her children\'s welfare; he merely exposes them, and is often extremely annoyed when they fail to thrive on their own account. The decided lack he usually displays in practical ability, and his aversion from any sort of re[accent]clame assist in this attitude. If to his eyes his product appears subjectively correct and true, it must also be so in practice, and others have simply got to bow to its truth. Hardly ever will he go out of his way to win anyone\'s appreciation of it, especially if it be anyone of influence. And, when he brings himself to do so, he is usually so extremely maladroit that he merely achieves the opposite of his purpose. In his own special province, there are usually awkward experiences with his colleagues, since he never knows how to win their favour; as a rule he only succeeds in showing them how entirely superfluous they are to him. In the pursuit of his ideas he is generally stubborn, head-strong, and quite unamenable to influence. His suggestibility to personal influences is in strange contrast to this. An object has only to be recognized as apparently innocuous for such a type to become extremely accessible to really inferior elements. They lay hold of him from the [p. 487] unconscious. He lets himself be brutalized and exploited in the most ignominious way, if only he can be left undisturbed in the pursuit of his ideas. He simply does not see when he is being plundered behind his back and wronged in practical ways: this is because his relation to the object is such a secondary matter that lie is left without a guide in the purely objective valuation of his product. In thinking out his problems to the utmost of his ability, he also complicates them, and constantly becomes entangled in every possible scruple. However clear to himself the inner structure of his thoughts may be, he is not in the least clear where and how they link up with the world of reality. Only with difficulty can he persuade himself to admit that what is clear to him may not be equally clear to everyone. His style is usually loaded and complicated by all sorts of accessories, qualifications, saving clauses, doubts, etc., which spring from his exacting scrupulousness. His work goes slowly and with difficulty. Either he is taciturn or he falls among people who cannot understand him; whereupon he proceeds to gather further proof of the unfathomable stupidity of man. If he should ever chance to be understood, he is credulously liable to overestimate. Ambitious women have only to understand how advantage may be taken of his uncritical attitude towards the object to make an easy prey of him; or he may develop into a misanthropic bachelor with a childlike heart. Then, too, his outward appearance is often gauche, as if he were painfully anxious to escape observation; or he may show a remarkable unconcern, an almost childlike naivete. In his own particular field of work he provokes violent contradiction, with which he has no notion how to deal, unless by chance he is seduced by his primitive affects into biting and fruitless polemics. By his wider circle he is counted inconsiderate and domineering. But the [p. 488] better one knows him, the more favourable one\'s judgment becomes, and his nearest friends are well aware how to value his intimacy. To people who judge him from afar he appears prickly, inaccessible, haughty; frequently he may even seem soured as a result of his anti-social prejudices. He has little influence as a personal teacher, since the mentality of his pupils is strange to him. Besides, teaching has, at bottom, little interest for him, except when it accidentally provides him with a theoretical problem. He is a poor teacher, because while teaching his thought is engaged with the actual material, and will not be satisfied with its mere presentation.\n\nWith the intensification of his type, his convictions become all the more rigid and unbending. Foreign influences are eliminated; he becomes more unsympathetic to his peripheral world, and therefore more dependent upon his intimates. His expression becomes more personal and inconsiderate and his ideas more profound, but they can no longer be adequately expressed in the material at hand. This lack is replaced by emotivity and susceptibility. The foreign influence, brusquely declined from without, reaches him from within, from the side of the unconscious, and he is obliged to collect evidence against it and against things in general which to outsiders seems quite superfluous. Through the subjectification of consciousness occasioned by his defective relationship to the object, what secretly concerns his own person now seems to him of chief importance. And he begins to confound his subjective truth with his own person. Not that he will attempt to press anyone personally with his convictions, but he will break out with venomous and personal retorts against every criticism, however just. Thus in every respect his isolation gradually increases. His originally fertilizing ideas become destructive, because poisoned by a kind of sediment of bitterness. His struggle against the influences emanating [p. 489] from the unconscious increases with his external isolation, until gradually this begins to cripple him. A still greater isolation must surely protect him from the unconscious influences, but as a rule this only takes him deeper into the conflict which is destroying him within.\n\nThe thinking of the introverted type is positive and synthetic in the development of those ideas which in ever increasing measure approach the eternal validity of the primordial images. But, when their connection with objective experience begins to fade, they become mythological and untrue for the present situation. Hence this thinking holds value only for its contemporaries, just so long as it also stands in visible and understandable connection with the known facts of the time. But, when thinking becomes mythological, its irrelevancy grows until finally it gets lost in itself. The relatively unconscious functions of feeling, intuition, and sensation, which counterbalance introverted thinking, are inferior in quality and have a primitive, extraverted character, to which all the troublesome objective influences this type is subject to must be ascribed. The various measures of self-defence, the curious protective obstacles with which such people are wont to surround themselves, are sufficiently familiar, and I may, therefore, spare myself a description of them. They all serve as a defence against \'magical\' influences; a vague dread of the other sex also belongs to this category.""\n\nDiscuss.']","['Creators', 'Personality', 'ISTP - Crafter']",ISTP - Crafter
102,140,"The Extraverted Thinking Type - Carl Jung, Psychological Types","['""2. The Extraverted Thinking Type\n\nIt is a fact of experience that all the basic psychological functions seldom or never have the same strength or grade of development in one and the same individual. As a rule, one or other function predominates, in both strength and development. When supremacy among the psychological functions is given to thinking, i.e. when the life of an individual is mainly ruled by reflective thinking so that every important action proceeds from intellectually considered motives, or when there is at least a tendency to conform to such motives, we may fairly call this a thinking type. Such a type can be either introverted or extraverted. We will first discuss the extraverted thinking type.\n\nIn accordance with his definition, we must picture a, man whose constant aim -- in so far, of course, as he is a [p. 435] pure type -- is to bring his total life-activities into relation with intellectual conclusions, which in the last resort are always orientated by objective data, whether objective facts or generally valid ideas. This type of man gives the deciding voice-not merely for himself alone but also on behalf of his entourage-either to the actual objective reality or to its objectively orientated, intellectual formula. By this formula are good and evil measured, and beauty and ugliness determined. All is right that corresponds with this formula; all is wrong that contradicts it; and everything that is neutral to it is purely accidental. Because this formula seems to correspond with the meaning of the world, it also becomes a world-law whose realization must be achieved at all times and seasons, both individually and collectively. Just as the extraverted thinking type subordinates himself to his formula, so, for its own good, must his entourage also obey it, since the man who refuses to obey is wrong -- he is resisting the world-law, and is, therefore, unreasonable, immoral, and without a conscience. His moral code forbids him to tolerate exceptions; his ideal must, under all circumstances, be realized; for in his eyes it is the purest conceivable formulation of objective reality, and, therefore, must also be generally valid truth, quite indispensable for the salvation of man. This is not from any great love for his neighbour, but from a higher standpoint of justice and truth. Everything in his own nature that appears to invalidate this formula is mere imperfection, an accidental miss-fire, something to be eliminated on the next occasion, or, in the event of further failure, then clearly a sickness.\n\nIf tolerance for the sick, the suffering, or the deranged should chance to be an ingredient in the formula, special provisions will be devised for humane societies, hospitals, prisons, colonies, etc., or at least extensive plans for such projects. For the actual execution of these schemes the [p. 436] motives of justice and truth do not, as a rule, suffice; still devolve upon real Christian charity, which I to do with feeling than with any intellectual \'One really should\' or I one must\' figure largely in this programme. If the formula is wide enough, it may play a very useful rÃ´le in social life, with a reformer or a ventilator of public wrongs or a purifier of the public conscience, or as the propagator of important innovations. But the more rigid the formula, the more, does he develop into a grumbler, a crafty reasoner, and a self-righteous critic, who would like to impress both himself and others into one schema.\n\nWe have now outlined two extreme figures, between which terminals the majority of these types may be graduated.\n\nIn accordance with the nature of the extraverted attitude, the influence and activities of such personalities are all the more favourable and beneficent, the further one goes from the centre. Their best aspect is to be found at the periphery of their sphere of influence. The further we penetrate into their own province, the more do the unfavourable results of their tyranny impress us. Another life still pulses at the periphery, where the truth of the formula can be sensed as an estimable adjunct to the rest. But the further we probe into the special sphere where the formula operates, the more do we find life ebbing away from all that fails to coincide with its dictates. Usually it is the nearest relatives who have to taste the most disagreeable results of an extraverted formula, since they are the first to be unmercifully blessed with it. But above all the subject himself is the one who suffers most -- which brings us to the other side of the psychology of this type.\n\nThe fact that an intellectual formula never has been and never will be discovered which could embrace the [p. 437] abundant possibilities of life in a fitting expression must lead -- where such a formula is accepted -- to an inhibition, or total exclusion, of other highly important forms and activities of life. In the first place, all those vital forms dependent upon feeling will become repressed in such a type, as, for instance, aesthetic activities, taste, artistic sense, the art of friendship, etc. Irrational forms, such as religious experiences, passions and the like, are often obliterated even to the point of complete unconsciousness. These, conditionally quite important, forms of life have to support an existence that is largely unconscious. Doubtless there are exceptional men who are able to sacrifice their entire life to one definite formula; but for most of us a permanent life of such exclusiveness is impossible. Sooner or later -- in accordance with outer circumstances and inner gifts -- the forms of life repressed by the intellectual attitude become indirectly perceptible, through a gradual disturbance of the conscious conduct of life. Whenever disturbances of this kind reach a definite intensity, one speaks of a neurosis. In most cases, however, it does not go so far, because the individual instinctively allows himself some preventive extenuations of his formula, worded, of course, in a suitable and reasonable way. In this way a safety-valve is created.\n\nThe relative or total unconsciousness of such tendencies or functions as are excluded from any participation in the conscious attitude keeps them in a relatively undeveloped state. As compared with the conscious function they are inferior. To the extent that they are unconscious, they become merged with the remaining contents of the unconscious, from which they acquire a bizarre character. To the extent that they are conscious, they only play a secondary rÃ´le, although one of considerable importance for the whole psychological picture.\n\nSince feelings are the first to oppose and contradict [p. 438] the rigid intellectual formula, they are affected first this conscious inhibition, and upon them the most intense repression falls. No function can be entirely eliminated -- it can only be greatly distorted. In so far as feelings allow themselves to be arbitrarily shaped and subordinated, they have to support the intellectual conscious attitude and adapt themselves to its aims. Only to a certain degree, however, is this possible; a part of the feeling remains insubordinate, and therefore must be repressed. Should the repression succeed, it disappears from consciousness and proceeds to unfold a subconscious activity, which runs counter to conscious aims, even producing effects whose causation is a complete enigma to the individual. For example, conscious altruism, often of an extremely high order, may be crossed by a secret self-seeking, of which the individual is wholly unaware, and which impresses intrinsically unselfish actions with the stamp of selfishness. Purely ethical aims may lead the individual into critical situations, which sometimes have more than a semblance of being decided by quite other than ethical motives. There are guardians of public morals or voluntary rescue-workers who suddenly find themselves in deplorably compromising situations, or in dire need of rescue. Their resolve to save often leads them to employ means which only tend to precipitate what they most desire to avoid. There are extraverted idealists, whose desire to advance the salvation of man is so consuming that they will not shrink from any lying and dishonest means in the pursuit of their ideal. There are a few painful examples in science where investigators of the highest esteem, from a profound conviction of the truth and general validity of their formula, have not scrupled to falsify evidence in favour of their ideal. This is sanctioned by the formula; the end justifieth the means. Only an inferior feeling-function, operating seductively [p. 439] and unconsciously, could bring about such aberrations in otherwise reputable men.\n\nThe inferiority of feeling in this type manifests itself also in other ways. In so far as it corresponds with the dominating positive formula, the conscious attitude becomes more or less impersonal, often, indeed, to such a degree that a very considerable wrong is done to personal interests. When the conscious attitude is extreme, all personal considerations recede from view, even those which concern the individual\'s own person. His health is neglected, his social position deteriorates, often the most vital interests of his family are violated -- they are wronged morally and financially, even their bodily health is made to suffer -- all in the service of the ideal. At all events personal sympathy with others must be impaired, unless they too chance to be in the service of the same formula. Hence it not infrequently happens that his immediate family circle, his own children for instance, only know such a father as a cruel tyrant, whilst the outer world resounds with the fame of his humanity. Not so much in spite of as because of the highly impersonal character of the conscious attitude, the unconscious feelings are highly personal and oversensitive, giving rise to certain secret prejudices, as, for instance, a decided readiness to misconstrue any objective opposition to his formula as personal ill-will, or a constant tendency to make negative suppositions regarding the qualities of others in order to invalidate their arguments beforehand-in defence, naturally, of his own susceptibility. As a result of this unconscious sensitiveness, his expression and tone frequently becomes sharp, pointed, aggressive, and insinuations multiply. The feelings have an untimely and halting character, which is always a mark of the inferior function. Hence arises a pronounced tendency to resentment. However generous the individual sacrifice [p. 440] to the intellectual goal may be, the feelings are correspondingly petty, suspicious, crossgrained, and conservative. Everything new that is not already contained formula is viewed through a veil of unconscious and is judged accordingly. It happened only in middle of last century that a certain physician, famed his humanitarianism, threatened to dismiss an assistant for daring to use a thermometer, because the formula decreed that fever shall be recognized by the pulse. There are, of course, a host of similar examples.\n\nThinking which in other respects may be altogether blameless becomes all the more subtly and prejudicially, affected, the more feelings are repressed. An intellectual standpoint, which, perhaps on account of its actual intrinsic value, might justifiably claim general recognition, undergoes a characteristic alteration through the influence of this unconscious personal sensitiveness; it becomes rigidly dogmatic. The personal self-assertion is transferred to the intellectual standpoint. Truth is no longer left to work her natural effect, but through an identification with the subject she is treated like a sensitive darling whom an evil-minded critic has wronged. The critic is demolished, if possible with personal invective, and no argument is too gross to be used against him. Truth must be trotted out, until finally it begins to dawn upon the public that it is not so much really a question of truth as of her personal procreator.\n\nThe dogmatism of the intellectual standpoint, however, occasionally undergoes still further peculiar modifications from the unconscious admixture of unconscious personal feelings; these changes are less a question of feeling, in the stricter sense, than of contamination from other unconscious factors which become blended with the repressed feeling in the unconscious. Although reason itself offers proof, that every intellectual formula can be no more than [p. 441] a partial truth, and can never lay claim, therefore, to autocratic authority; in practice, the formula obtains so great an ascendancy that, beside it, every other standpoint and possibility recedes into the background. It replaces all the more general, less defined, hence the more modest and truthful, views of life. It even takes the place of that general view of life which we call religion. Thus the formula becomes a religion, although in essentials it has not the smallest connection with anything religious. Therewith it also gains the essentially religious character of absoluteness. It becomes, as it were, an intellectual superstition. But now all those psychological tendencies that suffer under its repression become grouped together in the unconscious, and form a counter-position, giving rise to paroxysms of doubt. As a defence against doubt, the conscious attitude grows fanatical. For fanaticism, after all, is merely overcompensated doubt. Ultimately this development leads to an exaggerated defence of the conscious position, and to the gradual formation of an absolutely antithetic unconscious position; for example, an extreme irrationality develops, in opposition to the conscious rationalism, or it becomes highly archaic and superstitious, in opposition to a conscious standpoint imbued with modern science. This fatal opposition is the source of those narrow-minded and ridiculous views, familiar to the historians of science, into which many praiseworthy pioneers have ultimately blundered. It not infrequently happens in a man of this type that the side of the unconscious becomes embodied in a woman.\n\nIn my experience, this type, which is doubtless familiar to my readers, is chiefly found among men, since thinking tends to be a much more dominant function in men than in women. As a rule, when thinking achieves the mastery in women, it is, in my experience, a kind of thinking which results from a prevailingly intuitive activity of mind. [p. 442]\n\nThe thought of the extraverted thinking type is, positive, i.e. it produces. It either leads to new facts or to general conceptions of disparate experimental material. Its judgment is generally synthetic. Even when it analyses, it constructs, because it is always advancing beyond the, analysis to a new combination, a further conception which reunites the analysed material in a new way or adds some., thing further to the given material. In general, therefore, we may describe this kind of judgment as predicative. In any case, characteristic that it is never absolutely depreciatory or destructive, but always substitutes a fresh value for one that is demolished. This quality is due to the fact that thought is the main channel into which a thinking-type\'s energy flows. Life steadily advancing shows itself in the man\'s thinking, so that his ideas maintain a progressive, creative character. His thinking neither stagnates, nor is it in the least regressive. Such qualities cling only to a thinking that is not given priority in consciousness. In this event it is relatively unimportant, and also lacks the character of a positive vital activity. It follows in the wake of other functions, it becomes Epimethean, it has an \'esprit de l\'escalier\' quality, contenting itself with constant ponderings and broodings upon things past and gone, in an effort to analyse and digest them. Where the creative element, as in this case, inhabits another function, thinking no longer progresses it stagnates. Its judgment takes on a decided inherency-character, i.e. it entirely confines itself to the range of the given material, nowhere overstepping it. It is contented with a more or less abstract statement, and fails to impart any value to the experimental material that was not already there.\n\nThe inherency-judgment of such extraverted thinking is objectively orientated, i.e. its conclusion always expresses the objective importance of experience. Hence, not only does it remain under the orientating influence of objective [p. 443]\n\ndata, but it actually rests within the charmed circle of the individual experience, about which it affirms nothing that was not already given by it. We may easily observe this thinking in those people who cannot refrain from tacking on to an impression or experience some rational and doubtless very valid remark, which, however, in no way adventures beyond the given orbit of the experience. At bottom, such a remark merely says \'I have understood it -- I can reconstruct it.\' But there the matter also ends. At its very highest, such a judgment signifies merely the placing of an experience in an objective setting, whereby the experience is at once recognized as belonging to the frame.\n\nBut whenever a function other than thinking possesses priority in consciousness to any marked degree, in so far as thinking is conscious at all and not directly dependent upon the dominant function, it assumes a negative character. In so far as it is subordinated to the dominant function, it may actually wear a positive aspect, but a narrower scrutiny will easily prove that it simply mimics the dominant function, supporting it with arguments that unmistakably contradict the laws of logic proper to thinking. Such a thinking, therefore, ceases to have any interest for our present discussion. Our concern is rather with the constitution of that thinking which cannot be subordinated to the dominance of another function, but remains true to its own principle. To observe and investigate this thinking in itself is not easy, since, in the concrete case, it is more or less constantly repressed by the conscious attitude. Hence, in the majority of cases, it first must be retrieved from the background of consciousness, unless in some unguarded moment it should chance to come accidentally to the surface. As a rule, it must be enticed with some such questions as \'Now what do you really think?\' or, again, \'What is your private view [p. 444] about the matter?\' Or perhaps one may even use a little cunning, framing the question something this: \'What do you imagine, then, that I really think about the matter?\' This latter form should be chosen when the real thinking is unconscious and, therefore projected. The thinking that is enticed to the surface this way has characteristic qualities; it was these I had in mind just now when I described it as negative. It habitual mode is best characterized by the two words \'nothing but\'. Goethe personified this thinking in the figure of Mephistopheles. It shows a most distinctive tendency to trace back the object of its judgment to some banality or other, thus stripping it of its own independent significance. This happens simply because it is represented as being dependent upon some other commonplace thing. Wherever a conflict, apparently essential in nature, arises between two men, negative thinking mutters \'Cherchez la femme\'. When a man champions or advocates a cause, negative thinking makes no inquiry as to the importance of the thing, but merely asks \'How much does he make by it?\' The dictum ascribed to Moleschott: ""Der Mensch ist, was er isst"" ("" Man is what he eats "") also belongs to this collection, as do many more aphorisms and opinions which I need not enumerate.\n\nThe destructive quality of this thinking as well as its occasional and limited usefulness, hardly need further elucidation. But there still exists another form of negative thinking, which at first glance perhaps would scarcely be recognized as such I refer to the theosophical thinking which is to-day rapidly spreading in every quarter of the globe, presumably as a reaction phenomenon to the materialism of the epoch now receding. Theosophical thinking has an air that is not in the least reductive, since it exalts everything to transcendental and world-embracing ideas. A dream, for instance, is no [p. 445] longer a modest dream, but an experience upon \'another plane\'. The hitherto inexplicable fact of telepathy is ,very simply explained by \'vibrations\' which pass from one man to another. An ordinary nervous trouble is quite simply accounted for by the fact that something has collided with the astral body. Certain anthropological peculiarities of the dwellers on the Atlantic seaboard are easily explained by the submerging of Atlantis, and so on. We have merely to open a theosophical book to be overwhelmed by the realization that everything is already explained, and that \'spiritual science\' has left no enigmas of life unsolved. But, fundamentally, this sort of thinking is just as negative as materialistic thinking. When the latter conceives psychology as chemical changes taking place in the cell-ganglia, or as the extrusion and withdrawal of cell-processes, or as an internal secretion, in essence this is just as superstitious as theosophy. The only difference lies in the fact that materialism reduces all phenomena to our current physiological notions, while theosophy brings everything into the concepts of Indian metaphysics. When we trace the dream to an overloaded stomach, the dream is not thereby explained, and when we explain telepathy as \'vibrations\', we have said just as little. Since, what are \'vibrations\'? Not only are both methods of explanation quite impotent -- they are actually destructive, because by interposing their seeming explanations they withdraw interest from the problem, diverting it in the former case to the stomach, and in the latter to imaginary vibrations, thus preventing any serious investigation of the problem. Either kind of thinking is both sterile and sterilizing. Their negative quality consists in this it is a method of thought that is indescribably cheap there is a real poverty of productive and creative energy. It is a thinking taken in tow by other functions. [p. 446]""']","['Guardians', 'ESTJ - Supervisor', 'Personality']",ESTJ - Supervisor
103,141,"The Introverted Sensing Type - Carl Jung, Psychological Type","['""7. The Introverted Sensation Type\n\nThe priority of introverted sensation produces a definite type, which is characterized by certain peculiarities. It is an irrational type, inasmuch as its selection among occurrences is not primarily rational, but is guided rather [p. 501] by what just happens. Whereas, the extraverted sensation-type is determined by the intensity of the objective influence, the introverted type is orientated by the intensity of the subjective sensation-constituent released by the objective stimulus. Obviously, therefore, no sort of proportional relation exists between object and sensation, but something that is apparently quite irregular and arbitrary judging from without, therefore, it is practically impossible to foretell what will make an impression and what will not. If there were present a capacity and readiness for expression in any way commensurate with the strength of sensation, the irrationality of this type would be extremely evident. This is the case, for instance, when the individual is a creative artist. But, since this is the exception, it usually happens that the characteristic introverted difficulty of expression also conceals his irrationality. On the contrary, he may actually stand out by the very calmness and passivity of his demeanour, or by his rational self-control. This peculiarity, which often leads the superficial judgment astray, is really due to his unrelatedness to objects. Normally the object is not consciously depreciated in the least, but its stimulus is removed from it, because it is immediately replaced by a subjective reaction, which is no longer related to the reality of the object. This, of course, has the same effect as a depreciation of the object. Such a type can easily make one question why one should exist at all; or why objects in general should have any right to existence, since everything essential happens without the object. This doubt may be justified in extreme cases, though not in the normal, since the objective stimulus is indispensable to his sensation, only it produces something different from what was to be surmised from the external state of affairs. Considered from without, it looks as though the effect of the object [p. 502] did not obtrude itself upon the subject. This impression is so far correct inasmuch as a subjective content does, in fact, intervene from the unconscious, thus snatching away the effect of the object. This intervention may be so abrupt that the individual appears to shield himself directly from any possible influence of the object. In any aggravated or well-marked case, such a protective guard is also actually present. Even with only a slight reinforcement of the unconscious, the subjective constituent of sensation becomes so alive that it almost completely obscures the objective influence. The results of this are, on the one hand, a feeling of complete depreciation on the part of the object, and, on the other, an illusory conception of reality on the part of the subject, which in morbid cases may even reach the point of a complete inability to discriminate between the real object and the subjective perception. Although so vital a distinction vanishes completely only in a practically psychotic state, yet long before that point is reached subjective perception may influence thought, feeling, and action to an extreme degree, in spite of the fact that the object is clearly seen in its fullest reality. Whenever the objective influence does succeed in forcing its way into the subject -- as the result of particular circumstances of special intensity, or because of a more perfect analogy with the unconscious image -- even the normal example of this type is induced to act in accordance with his unconscious model. Such action has an illusory quality in relation to objective reality, and therefore has a very odd and strange character. It instantly reveals the anti-real subjectivity of the type, But, where the influence of the object does not entirely succeed, it encounters a benevolent neutrality, disclosing little sympathy, yet constantly striving to reassure and adjust. The too-low is raised a little, the too-high is made a little lower; the enthusiastic is damped, the [p. 503] extravagant restrained; and the unusual brought within the \'correct\' formula: all this in order to keep the influence of the object within the necessary bounds. Thus, this type becomes an affliction to his circle, just in so far as his entire harmlessness is no longer above suspicion. But, if the latter should be the case, the individual readily becomes a victim to the aggressiveness and ambitions of others. Such men allow themselves to be abused, for which they usually take vengeance at the most unsuitable occasions with redoubled stubbornness and resistance. When there exists no capacity for artistic expression, all impressions sink into the inner depths, whence they hold consciousness under a spell, removing any possibility it might have had of mastering the fascinating impression by means of conscious expression. Relatively speaking, this type has only archaic possibilities of expression for the disposal of his impressions; thought and feeling are relatively unconscious, and, in so far as they have a certain consciousness, they only serve in the necessary, banal, every-day expressions. Hence as conscious functions, they are wholly unfitted to give any adequate rendering of the subjective perceptions. This type, therefore, is uncommonly inaccessible to an objective understanding and he fares no better in the understanding of himself.\n\nAbove all, his development estranges him from the reality of the object, handing him over to his subjective perceptions, which orientate his consciousness in accordance with an archaic reality, although his deficiency in comparative judgment keeps him wholly unaware of this fact. Actually he moves in a mythological world, where men animals, railways, houses, rivers, and mountains appear partly as benevolent deities and partly as malevolent demons. That thus they, appear to him never enters his mind, although their effect upon his judgments and acts can bear no other interpretation. He judges and acts as [p. 504] though he had such powers to deal with; but this begins to strike him only when he discovers that his sensations are totally different from reality. If his tendency is to reason objectively, he will sense this difference as morbid; but if, on the other hand, he remains faithful to his irrationality, and is prepared to grant his sensation reality value, the objective world will appear a mere make-belief and a comedy. Only in extreme cases, however, is this dilemma reached. As a rule, the individual acquiesces in his isolation and in the banality of the reality, which, however, he unconsciously treats archaically.\n\nHis unconscious is distinguished chiefly by the repression of intuition, which thereby acquires an extraverted and archaic character. Whereas true extraverted intuition has a characteristic resourcefulness, and a \'good nose\' for every possibility in objective reality, this archaic, extraverted intuition has an amazing flair for every ambiguous, gloomy, dirty, and dangerous possibility in the background of reality. In the presence of this intuition the real and conscious intention of the object has no significance; it will peer behind every possible archaic antecedent of such an intention. It possesses, therefore, something dangerous, something actually undermining, which often stands in most vivid contrast to the gentle benevolence of consciousness. So long as the individual is not too aloof from the object, the unconscious intuition effects a wholesome compensation to the rather fantastic and over credulous attitude of consciousness. But as soon as the unconscious becomes antagonistic to consciousness, such intuitions come to the surface and expand their nefarious influence: they force themselves compellingly upon the individual, releasing compulsive ideas about objects of the most perverse kind. The neurosis arising from this sequence of events is usually a compulsion neurosis, in which the hysterical characters recede and are obscured by symptoms of exhaustion.

106,144,Iganokami's Guide to the INTP Mate,"['I found this list on a couple of INTP forums and thought it was something interesting. I personally found it to be mostly true for me. Even, embarrassingly, #6. The way I express love is ridiculous. It would seem that the only people who are compatible with us INTPs are those that find quirky hermits endearing. :P\n\n1. Lots of sex\nI dont think it is just me as an INTP who finds this a very important part of a relationship and the most important physical expression of love in a relationship - it is NOT a selfish act for selfish physical satisfaction. but hell, it is damn pleasing, too\n\n2. Moral support\nIt is a tough world out there for INTPs\n\n3. An equal\nINTPs have no wish to dominate, and are crushed by domination\n\n4. Someone who is next to unoffendable\nINTPs tend to lack tact, but also want and need to be brutally honest with thier intimate partners - they want someone who they can playfully insult, who will then either laugh in thier face or give it right back.\n\n5. Someone who can accept them for who they are and not try to change them.\nINTPs appear erratic to the casual observer in a relationship, for example - they appear to demand solitude one moment, sex the next. Non-INTPs find this VERY hard to reconcile with their typical conception of ""love""\n\n6. Someone who accepts the peculiar WAYS they show their love.\nBe it really, really sappy hopeless-romantic type drivel or passionate physical expression, or just a touch or a simple look. The INTP way is very hard to catch, if you blink, you miss it. Non-INTPs tend to want tokens and words, not a slow dance in a room with no radio, not a quiet cuddle in front of the TV at the end of the day, or the other strange and random expressions that INTPs tend to give. [This ties in with #5.]\n\n7. SPACE [as in both physical and emotional space]\nIn case it was missed, I\'ll mention it again: SPACE!! INTP men need their free time to pursue intellectual pursuits, and CAN NOT be:\na.) disturbed\nb.) told they dont love thier partner because they spend too much time ""alone"", etc.\nINTP men disappear for a while, then come out swinging. this FORCES most non-INTPs to think that the INTP partner only wants them for sex. This is wrong, but if the non-INTP is not capable of #5 and #6, they are forced to believe it.\n\n8. Comforting. [this goes along with #2.]\nThe world sucks, particularly for INTPs. They are capable of an utterly staggering amount of patience and responsibility, but in the long run, without #2 and #8, the relationship will ultimately die, or the INTP will DIE a very real death. With #2 and #8, an INTP can take a spectacular amount of abuse, responsibility, and patience in life, as long as his partner supplies #2 and #8 in sufficient quantities.\n\n9. An intellect. a person who can hold their own in a debate.\nThe words ""you always think you are right!!"" are the LAST words an INTP wants to hear from their mate. The INTP wants debate! Wants intellectual stimulation! If they doesn\'t get it at home, #7 becomes very very very important. If their mate can not handle #7, there will be PROBLEMS. If the mate can supply #9, the INTP will be very happily occupied with their mate for a long, long time.\n\n10. Someone to learn with. [This goes with #9]\nSomeone who is interested in learning and intellectual stimulation. The INTP needs someone who they can learn with and enjoy the mysteries and adventures of life with. Someone who can understand their interest in the esoteric, show appreciation for their interests, and even join them in these interests, or introduce them to new ones.\n\n11. Someone capable of self reflection and self analysis.\nOften the INTP finds that they are the only one ""growing"" in a relationship, the only one who can see the problems in the relationship. This usually forces the INTP to be the one to change, to be the one to compromise for their partner. Because many non-INTPs have no true ability to self reflect the non-INTP thinks they are ALWAYS right. The INTP spends their life examining themselves and their relationship to see what they need to do to make it work. So they spend all their time critically analyzing it, and the mate does nothing but demand that they change. This will eventually lead to the spiritual DEATH of the INTP, if not the actual PHYSICAL death of the INTP. To avoid this, the INTP person NEEDS a mate who can examine the relationship WITH them, so they can grow TOGETHER.\n\n', ""I really like what you're saying about sex. lol."", 'Good post! This pretty much sums up my experience with INTPs.', ""This pretty much sums it up. In retrospect, it's interesting to me that the more I try to escape my INTP predicament, the more these characteristics become obvious. lol"", 'so know you have some of the rules (shivers) in place, what type would you think would be suitable to play the game based on them? not just going off what is already typed for your type, but it would be interesting to hear from some intps what other types they either have dated or would/wouldnt like to date.', 'Hit the nail on the head.\n', ""Haha i've seen this list before and it cracked me up. So accurate. My favorite part is about going from solitude to demanding sex. I wonder if a personality type exists that would suit all these needs... Maybe a very understanding ENFP who won't be offended by our need for alone time."", ""I love it, raises a ton of very insightful and important points. It's weird how often the author talks about these issues causing ACTUAL DEATH."", 'I find this article very true for myself.', ""Interested to know if INTPs desire more traditional expressions of love and affection even if they don't show it like that themselves?\n"", 'Very true 1 is like learning how you like it and experimenting with you\n4 I love to tease you to the level where you jus look at me and say sssh I kno you mean the exact opposite nd smile cause your that sure what I feel is real which goes with 6\nim not overly emotional unless it has to be and its one of those days where I understand complex emotions but I will always try to leave clues that I like specific things about tbh if I try spend time with you then I value your brain not nessarily book smarts but your way of seeimg things', '"" It would seem that the only people who are compatible with us INTPs are those that find quirky hermits endearing ""\nLove it :D', 'Spot on. I have personally lived through some of these scenarios, especially #11 gradually causing spiritual death.', ""Remarkably accurate; even revealed some things to me I hadn't considered, but that I can pin down as the cause for at least one past relationship ending.\nIf you find anything more like this around, do post it here!"", ""These are things INTP desires. Short of #1, you've described a best friend, not a mate. I see these as ideally mutually exclusive. These are things we want in life...not those we need. They're also hard to provided by the same one person. For example:\n\n1. Sex - Nice to have. Builds intimacy and bonding. When you get old, the sex goes away. This then cannot be a requirement for a mate unless you're planning to divorce when they dont put out anymore.\n\n2. Moral support - This would come from an F. And an E.\n\n3. An equal - While we may want it, what we need is for someone to take control of aspects of our life to make sure we have two matching socks, the bills get paid and we end up eating regularly. If they can take control of the exterior and leave us in control of our interior...that's close to equal I suppose, but still likely needing a J.\n\n4. Someone who is next to unoffendable - This is NOT an F.\n\n5. Someone who doesnt want to change them and accepts them - This is exceedingly rare. Another INTP would be the closest thing but likely one of you will end up wishing the other would just do the laundry, or were more socially open so they could answer the phone for you. Anyone else may come to accept your flaws but will still wish you were different in some sort of way because you're not meeting their need (like emotionally).\nThis is most likely an INTP.\n\n6. Peculiar love - Ts will just think your being awkward and Fs would have to be perceptive enough to know that *any* small act of kindness or random nicety *is* their way of telling you they love you.\nThat time they made that god awful dinner for you both? They are *gushing* with love for you.\n\n7. Space - Hard to provide in a relationship unless your with someone else who's more than content to be by themselves, or goes out a lot with their friends. This is most likely an I as Es will want interaction.\n\n8. Comforting - See morale support. Likely E#F#.\n\n9. Holding their own in a debate - Unless they can keep emotion out of it, it just deteriorates into an arguent for them. Also, you need differences of opinion and that request difference of perspective for the debate to be valuable. So this is likely a ST in order to work.\n\n10. Someone to learn with - there's emotional learning and intellectual learning. Since we struggle with the emotional learning, this would likely be a T.\n\n11. Someone capable of self reflection and analysis - so this is an NT.\n\nLooking at this from the inverse then, we desire an E&I / S&N / F&T / P&J. Most of it, we desire those like ourselves that can accept us for us, can understand us and share like-minded thoughts. See the world similar to the way we see it and enjoys the things we do.\n\nThese are called friends.\n\nWhat we need is our opposites for mates. Those that drive us. Those that better us. That see things in a way we do not. Those that provide us the data we are missing, not those that validify our (possibly) skewed logic. Those that fill the roles we suck at and those that we can fill the roles for....it allows for both the feel complete and valuable to the other.\n\nAppreciate people for their differences.

107,145,INFJ Lesbian- Difficulty finding a good match. Suggestions?,"['As an INFJ...I found it very difficult to find a good match in the lesbian community. And I don\'t switch teams so in case anyone on here wants to suggest it...lol...that isn\'t an option. Apparently my mbti is around 1-2 percent of the population...which I believe because aside from some family and close friends it seems I haven\'t met a lot of people in life who ""get"" me...or maybe the issue is ""believe"" me when I allow myself to be ""seen?"" The ironic thing is that I am pretty transparent and I love learning about and understanding others. Anyway...please check out my profile..I am a full time carpenter and very confident in what I can bring to a relationship:)\n\nLet me know if you have suggestions. i may even be open minded to match making if you know a particularly awesome, stable, lesbian (25ish to 38 or so) with a dominant intuitive personality type. I think I also lean towards Thinking Judgers...but I am open minded:) am not from St. Louis and intend to relocate to a more ""progressive"" city within the next year...I\'m leaning towards the east coast because I have more friends there, but Madison WI and Cali have crossed my mind...particularly considering the latest Supreme Court Ruling.\n\nThanks for reading!', 'Hello ThinkHappy365!\n\nWelcome to the Evolove Project, particularly here in the INFJ Forum.\nThanks for sharing your testimony of your experience with relationships, in your\nspecific pursuit of happiness!\nI\'d like to further your topic of conversation, as I have come across the question\nof gender/sexual orientation\'s affect on type interaction quite a few times before.\nMy personal opinion is based on my own experience, so I will emphasize on the\nfact that it is not a general truth that I will speak of.\n\nAs an INFJ, with sexual and social primary instincts, I tend to appear as very assertive, dominant in my way of perceiving the world (the introverted intuition ""shines"" through my Se), yet I treat all the information through the lens of my internal logic, based on my feelings (Fe-Ti process). This way of being creates very defined dynamics in terms of energy in interactions.\nI tend to attract females, even straight ones, on a regular basis because, I give off this dominant ""alpha"" type of intuition that is probably them mistaking me for an INTJ ""Hawkeye"" - which happens very regularly- and expecting me to be very rational, logical and less empathic, emotionally-driven.\n\nMy best female friend, that I have typed ISTP, is a lesbian as well, and she ""came out"" for the first time to me, by expressing her love for me.\nI believe that the regular Intuition/Sensing bridge gap can be overlooked when there is an orientation of sexual drive that is targeted to different cognitively-functional sex-appeals.\n\nAs an exemple, I can testify that being brought up in an S(i)-Dom household, by an ISFJ mother, where all others had inferior intuition, I have had to highly develop my extraverted Sensing in order to gather information, knowledge and that has caused me to be very assertive, sexually-driven in terms of achieving sensory perception, especially towards my mother, which was the only parent present regularly in the household.\n\nIn that sense, I can say I am particularly comfortable to express my sexual drive to other e, and to direct it to them, and some women are drawn to this aspect of me.\nHowever, I believe that my ""lesbian-side"" of my personality - the sexual drive - is only and purely material in the sense that it is accomplished in order to gather, process information, and not ideal in terms of my expectations of accession to pleasurable love.\n\nAlso, this process is not exclusive to the female gender, and it happens more often than not, when I interact with NTPs, that I use it in order to work out their extraverted intuition, since their sensing is inferior, and they need to be somewhat ""stimulated"" to captivate their intellectual expression.\n\nIn that sense, I find that it feels more like working out my senses, than pleasurably sensing them naturally, which I find to happen only with NF\'s and Se-Doms (mostly because the intellectual stimulation I require needs no external sensory drive to be perceived).\n\nI wonder if you could corroborate, or argue against this specific idea of understanding of function dominance, and sexual-drive as variables of a sexual orientation compabtibility with the social aspects of their expression.\nAnyone can feel free to answer, and continue the conversation!\nThank you for reading :)', 'Queer Infj here.', ""INFJs go really well with ENTPs. However, I think there are fewer female ENTPs. They also get along with INTPs, INTJs, ISTJs, and ENFJs. INTPs are most interested in the sciences, INTJs are also nerdy, ISTJs have a ton of interests and know a lot of stuff, and ENFJs are the most likely to be a leader.\n\nAvoid ISFPs. It seems great initially but is a car crash waiting to happen.\n\nI'm currently with an ISTP. An ISTP female, IMHO, is the most likely to have tattoo sleeves."", ""I think INTP girls are great for INFJs.

108,146,INFJ Lesbian- Difficulty finding a good match. Suggestions?,"['As an INFJ...I found it very difficult to find a good match in the lesbian community. And I don\'t switch teams so in case anyone on here wants to suggest it...lol...that isn\'t an option. Apparently my mbti is around 1-2 percent of the population...which I believe because aside from some family and close friends it seems I haven\'t met a lot of people in life who ""get"" me...or maybe the issue is ""believe"" me when I allow myself to be ""seen?"" The ironic thing is that I am pretty transparent and I love learning about and understanding others. Anyway...please check out my profile..I am a full time carpenter and very confident in what I can bring to a relationship:)\n\nLet me know if you have suggestions. i may even be open minded to match making if you know a particularly awesome, stable, lesbian (25ish to 38 or so) with a dominant intuitive personality type. I think I also lean towards Thinking Judgers...but I am open minded:) am not from St. Louis and intend to relocate to a more ""progressive"" city within the next year...I\'m leaning towards the east coast because I have more friends there, but Madison WI and Cali have crossed my mind...particularly considering the latest Supreme Court Ruling.\n\nThanks for reading!', ""Hi ThinkHappy- I just joined and came across your post. Your type is the 3rd smallest at 2.1% of the population, according to Myers-Briggs. I am an ENFP, though not a lesbian, and my type is shared with 8.1% of the population. I'm writing to you because at least one source predicts a great match between your type and ENFP's or ENTP's.\n\nPersonalityPage says: Although two well-developed individuals of any type can enjoy a healthy relationship, INFJ's natural partner is the ENTP, or the ENFP. INFJ's dominant function of Introverted Intuition is best matched with a personality type that is dominated by Extraverted Intuition. How did we arrive at this? You can read more here: http://www.personalitypage.com/html/INFJ_rel.html\n\nI just broke up with an ISTJ man, and am very curious to see what an INTJ or INFJ relationship would be like. I don't actually think I know anyone of this type! Anyway hope you have fun exploring here...\n\nJourney212"", ""I'm gay and also INFJ/INTJ, and I agree that finding a compatible partner is difficult. I am wondering if being LGBT adds another layer of complexity, and makes finding a match that much more difficult. I've also read online -forget where- that INFJs could be likened to being a whole separate orientation, and not neatly on the linear hetero-homo spectrum. I am not sure if I agree with that, but find the idea fascinating.\n\n"", 'I am an ENTJ and lesbian. And also doomed when it comes to relationships.', 'Thinkhappy, I think the problem you\'re running into is the fact a lot of lesbians have trust issues. I always maintain transparency because I think pretense is a huge waste of time and half the time I\'m not &quot;seen&quot; either. In fact, usually I get attributes projected upon me and then am asked to defend against things I don\'t think or feel and that is super annoying!\n\nI can\'t really recommend a type for you unfortunately but, I usually enjoy conversation with INFxs. My sister tested as an INFP and has been dating an INTJ for awhile. I think he grounds her and she softens him. I imagine the situation would be similar with an INFJ and an INTP; you\'d be the decisive but, sentimental one that pulls us out of our heads while, we brought &quot;logic&quot; and never ending imagination to the table. This match also has the bonus of having a shared dedication to personal growth or, what we call ""truth seeking"" The only problem I run into with INFxs is they tend to assume too much about my thoughts and feelings because I\'m not peculiarly emotive. INTPs are usually subtle but one that has matured can express her feelings in time. Since you\'re secure/social you might also enjoy our extroverted version but I don\'t have any personal experience with ENTPs so I can\'t give any insight there.\n\nWhatever type you choose maturity is the key!

Relationships
109,147,Introvets dating Introverts and vise versa,"['This site suggests that Introverts are better suited with Extrovert, but after my last relationship, I must disagree. Introvert/Extrovert relationship seemed to be unfulfilling for both of us as he wanted to spend much more time with groups of people, while I prefered smalled groups or just one on one experiences. For 2 years, our main problem was that we could not agree how to spend our time. I was okay with doing our seperate activities together. It was impossible because together for him ment having to socialize. We usually came to an agreement for him to go out and me staying in. This led to us spending almost no time together, until we realized that it was time to look for a better match.', ""I'd say it probably boils down to a combination of preference, and age or development. While I don't necessarily advocate the necessity of being with one's opposite I will say that ideally, an introvert through age or development will become more extroverted through use of his or her's second and fourth functions, just as an extravert will become more introverted through use of their's. (See Gift's Differing for more on that)\n\nBoth types need to be comfortable diving into each other's world, but being extraverted all the time for an introvert understandably sucks.\n\nMost extraverts can probably be made to understand that after a few hours you need to space out or just be alone, just as an introvert can understand that an extravert needs to have at least some (if not a lot of) interaction with the world. At the end of the day, it can be nice to have someone to help explore the of opposite sides of the world with. This helps us achieve balance and thereby enriches our introverted and extraverted lives respectively.\n\nAlso there might have been more at work instead of a simple incompatibility of extraversion and introversion, not knowing what to do with your time together could be caused by any other of the three dichotomies (S/N, T/F, J/P). It's not wrong to want to be with an introvert, one book by Alexander Avila recommends female INFPs with INFJs, Keirsey recommends INFP with ENTJ, this site recommends ESTJ, some sites even recommend INFPs with other INFPs."", 'I think one of the reasons they suggest it if because with opposite thinking, it can allow you to grow. Plus, having different personalities like that can come in handy. I am an ESTJ, and all of my best friends are introverts. (All 3 are INTJs.) They all take FOREVER to make decisions, and I rush into every decision I make. So, with all of them, they help me to think before I make a decision and I help them not to take 24 hours to decide which topping to get on a pizza. So, there is that benefit.', ""Kmaco, I absolutely agree, it all is not white or black. My past relationship was an ENFP, our interests were pretty much identical except for what I have listed above. And it is true, maybe we were just incompatible in a romantic relationship. I do think this site's evaluation on compatibly is most accurate that I've seen thus far. &quot;Secure, Sexual, Social&quot; is amazing me at the moment. Also, this site recommends intuitives with intuitives with which I absolutely agree. The only thing still puzzling is extroverts being best with introverts. With friends, for sure, but in a romatic relationship? It's one thing to undersdand and respect eachothers needs and another not being comfortable in that type of a relationship. Thanks for the recommendation. I will surely check that out.\n\nChuckNerd, it's interesting that you would bring up decision making. I would guess that all TJ's take their time with decisions as they are opposite of impulsive. On the other hand, I'm super impulsive but take forever to decide on what to order. My INTJs are great at pointing out logical positives and negative of the decision which helps me out. Moreover, I do agree with opposite thinking helping with growth but as long as it fascinates another. For example, I've super interested in thinkers because they are able to just go beyond their feelings. No offense to you and all other sensors out there, but I find myself having little in common with sensors. I am interested in deep conversations while they prefer more superficial discussions.\nGoing back to introversion vs. extroversion. Are you the one that is always talking/entertaining when in a group of your INTJs? In groups, I would have very little room to say anything with my ENFP around as he always wanted all the attention. I feel like that wouldn't give me any room for growth, instead just make me feel suppressed. I don't know. Just thoughts outloud.\n\n\n"", 'I am the friend that gets all of the attention and spends the time amusing everyone. And I absolutely love it. I think that may be why for extroverts, this site recommends you to be with an introvert. Otherwise, you may both be fighting for attention in the relationship, or when hanging out with friends, or there just might be some kind of disagreement there. Where as if there was one extravert and one introvert you can grow off of each other, if they are the right pair. There are other things to take into account. Not all INTJs are the same person. When I was younger, I was extremely rude and wanted to be the center of attention and very competitive. To the point where if I was playing rock, paper, scissors, I would tell people rock would beat paper as a ""paper holder"" just so I could win all the time by throwing rock. I eventually realized that no one wanted to be my friend and I was just bossy, so I started to develop my feeling side. So, as for my friends, I always try to be empathetic of when I am talking a lot and they even know me well enough that if I talk too much and they don\'t get their chance, they just tell me to shut up, and I do. Haha. Also, one thing I like about my introverted friends is they aren\'t so much ""introverts"" around me and their other friends.\nAs for decision making, as a TJ I normally think about it but usually not nearly as much, once I come to the decision, I get so excited I just want to act upon it, where as my friends come to the decision, and they think it over again... and again.... and again. From my point of view, it\'s good to rethink your decision before acting, so I do need to slow down sometimes but my friends need to realize not every decision in life is life or death. Haha (I don\'t have much patience.) Is that an extroverted thing? I know a lot of ESTJs don\'t have patience.\nAnd yeah as for the superficial conversations with the sensors I think it\'s just because sensors look at the big picture where as intuitive look much more at detail and into the future. There may be some sensors you can connect with depending on how much of a sensor they are.', '', '', ""As for the cognitive function, I don't know exactly. I know it's in the category of S/N. I think it's if you are introverted sensing then you tend to look at the big picture of things as opposed to details. Manipulation type of niceness? Do you mean as if someone pretends they're nice but really they're not? Because if so there are a lot of people out there that don't even realize they manipulate. They were brought up that way. I am someone that is very straight forward and says it like it is. But some people don't even know themselves enough that they don't even realize what they do.\nAs for the compliments. I love getting compliments like that as well. It's always good to be competitive, it gets you far in life."", 'I would agree that every relationship is different; however, I dated an ENFP, which is supposedly one of our best matches, as an INFJ, but I felt was one of my worse. I struggled significantly with the constant socialization and limelight he needed to be in. I was getting drained from all the social endeavors I was participating in. I just wanted some one on one time with him to have our own meaningful conversations.', ""Relationships really depends on the 2 people involved. There are so many variable that no single theory can capture billions of people. This is simply statistically impossible. True, personality types offer some sort of frame work but even within a particular MBTI etc there is variation.\n\nOne has to remember that each person looks at life through a set of lenses and those lenses are coloured by their upbringing, environment, experiences... Levels of maturity, commitment to personal growth and the ability to effectively communicate are some of the essentials to two different people staying together. If an E can understand the I's need for alone time and can provide that and the I can understand and support the E's desire to be among people and compromises can be made then sure, an E and an I can get along famously but I don't see that working if they both have extreme levels of introversion and extraversion."", ""These http://www.truereligion-outlet.com.co/ she http://www.uggs-onsale.net/

It would be interesting to find out which types tend to have that instinct. There is a post in INFJ that indicates Sexual/secure to be the most common for that type but my guess that would come up frequently for the NTs and NFs."", 'I just posted a few polls, one of which might help your question.

112,151,Cracking the INTJ - ENFP code?!?,"['The few encounters I had with INTJ females as an ENFP male where charged with sexual and mind stimulating intensity. It seems almost that the initial attraction is so strong and explosive that it is endangered to collapse very quickly. Which then results in the INTJ going back into their tunnel vision and the ENFP wandering on to explore the maze of the world.\nHowever my intuition tells me that INTJs have the ability to anchor and ground ENFPs with their strategic judgement and ENFPs can function as an inspiring connection to the outside world for INTJs. So there seems to be the positive potential for a long term relationship. My question is therefore: How do you guys deal with the intensity of the first encounter without freaking out in order to make it a sustainable relationship?', 'The thing is, usualy the one to freak out is the INTJ, and the ENFP (in my case at least) got dragged.\n\nThen eventually the INTJ begin to behave all the oposite to everything that she showed to you before.\n\nThere was always something in my INTJ exes that didn\'t tick ""right"". And this feeling always proved wrong.\n\nINFJs are where my future lies! :D\n\nBut i know that ENFPs just learn by experience, so good luck with that! lol', ""How do we deal without freakng out? Can't. We freak out, or pretend it's not happening."", ""And if we're not freaking out then we're totally blind to what's happening."", 'Had a long chat with an amazing INTJ girl yesterday. The solution seems to be the following according to her: As an ENFP always say for the record what is going on emotionally in that situation in a step by step analysis: 1) ""I feel that there is a strong attraction between us. How do you feel about it?"" 2) ""We should take things further in my opinion. How do you normally go about a situation like this?"". 3) I know that you need a lot of space and time to gain clarity over your emotions with regards to others. I am really happy to always give you that space as much as you need it. However right now there is this strong sexual tension between us. Therefore getting the sex out of the way asap would make the whole situation between us much more relaxed.""\nThere can be more than 2 steps building up to statement 3 if necessary. What do guys think?', 'Lol, there is no such thing as an amazing INTJ girl, they pretend to be amazing, they seen to be amazing and in the end it was just the lies of a psycopath that want to conquer you more than build anything together.\n\nI think i just got a bit traumatized!!! haha', ""Hey! Don't trash INTJs. People can never be amazing. In the end it is always a perception by the other person. It could just as well be that your perception of her was wrong (projection of expectations and hopes) and in the end she was just different. Happens everyday."", 'So you are telling me that ENFPs intimidate INTJ girls? If that is true that is very interesting and funny.\nWhat I know is the ENFPs style of communication is very dynamic, we are constantly jumping from subject to subject while making it creative and fun. Since they tend to focus on one thing I alway wondered how they keep up.', 'No Trix! If people tell and show something and then begin to act the exact oposite its not my fault to project things.\n\nIf so my biggest flaw (and other ENFPs around the world) was to believe somethingt that had been show just to be proven false by the own person that showed it.\n\nIts like someone explicitly say &quot;I will never open that door, just relax&quot; then after 5 minutes went there and open the door while looking at your face.', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FHpWyMydUE', 'i have watched THOR2 yesterday and LOL its SO like this tread!\n\nThe ENFP Thor needs to take the freaking INTJ girl out of the planet, have a lot of muscles, an imortal life etc to keep being interesting.\n\nBut you know, not all of us can keep being so interesting ALL the time. I called it a life for intjs, had enough! :D', 'Breaking up with an INTJ has been the most devastating thing of my life. After True Love, her majestic silence has been a rational Sword of Damocles that still hang upon my head, over my rainbows. Soon after the chaos, I began to write poems in ode to that symbolic tragedy of freedom and pain so that her departed love still remains a form of inspiration: now safer, clearer, stronger, true. It is her, it is real, she left me but I\'m still grateful for what happened.\nThe so called sadistic superstructure of an INTJ is just an excuse for superficial judgements. If you look well they\'re made of pure delicate thoughts, and when they decide something it is very hard to let them change their mind, expecially if you\'re an ENFP in whom they ""once"" put all of their faith.', ""I haven't met my ENFP other half yet. I am not convinced she even exists."", '*deleted (is there a delete button here?)', '', '', ""I think this relationship can work quite well - in fact, it's one of the best matches for ENFPs along with INFJs and other ENFPs.\n\nThe main issue I see is that ENFPs get infatuated very quickly, while INTJs usually take a long time to fall in love - sometimes months, or even years. ENFPs typically have to be extremely patient with INTJs, it seems.\n\nAlso, I think that the relationship usually works more effectively if the ENFP is very emotionally secure and independent. If the ENFP is quite sensitive or has unresolved issues, they will probably find the TJ bluntness hard to deal with.\n\nPersonally I would prefer to be with an INFJ, but I've met some lovely INTJ guys too."", ""Well, I am an INTJ that can fall in love 'quickly'. It won't take years. When the person has struck some sort of chord with me, they're in. It could take weeks. But that rarily happens...and yet I am fortunate to meet deeply interesting individuals from time to time. when it happens, it usually is genuine:) I think, we all seek truth and depth.\nMy experiences with ENFPs so far were not so positive, but I try not to generalize for the whole group. I think, ultimately it is also a case of maturity.\n\nThe ENFPs I knew, had issues with self-esteem and even one of them I think I have to classify as a narcissist in retrospect. Sure, really a people person on the surface...but I found it very fatiguing to deal with him. Like walking on eggshells the whole time.\n\nHe needed to be the center of adoration,his feelings needed to be considered at all times, him acting before he thought about it... and in the end, not considerate of my feelings, even when I expressed what the effect was. I had to resort to writing him a letter, that I forgave him despite of all this...but I just do not want to have anything to do with him.\n\nTechnically, I think INTJ &amp;ENFPs can boost each others strengths. There is also this chemistry with ENTPs....I have experienced that and I love it. There is such a flow of ideas :D\n\n\n"", ""This is interesting because three of my very closest friends are ENFP and I adore them as friends, but I could just NEVER see myself dating an ENFP. I can't really pinpoint a specific reason why, but I know a lot of ENFPs very well and have never felt an ounce of attraction to any of them."", ""I agree. I've known several confirmed ENFPs and probably many more. My sister is one as well. I have not met one yet with whom I could even fathom a relationship. I find them to often be very argumentative especially when they feel that righteousness is on their side (which seems to be most of the time). I may be a bit biased today, however, as I just spent an hour arguing with one."", '', '', 'im an enfp and have an unfortunate possession by intjs. to my knowledge (one relationship i had was before i was introduced to intjs so my data is incomplete) all of my romantic relationships have been with intjs. the sexual and intellectual stimuli intjs provide is so electrifying -even addicting - that i always find myself weak at the knees around them. That said i am single lol so i have never found an intj enfp pairing to be while erotic and provocative on many levels sustainable. intjs at least in my experience are very invalidating which is very damaging to an enfp especially a sensitive one (which we all tend to be) i have found intjs to be very dismissive of an enfps intellectual contributions because a lot of our knowledge is intuitive rather than factual and since we cant ""prove"" or quantify our beliefs in any factual way intjs disregard or insights as childish underdeveloped whims. cracking the enfp intj code: enfps fall hard for intjs but intjs either dont know how to show that they value their enfp or just simply dont value them for reasons stated above leading to disaster. having been burned so many times now this enfp is going to look for greener/more nurturing pastures in more NFs', 'As an INTJ myself, I find that I usually put forward a number of ""faces"". None of them are not me, they just are sides of me required for the task or interaction ahead. That might be why INTJs get a bad rep for not being honest and upfront, mainly because we function so differently. I don\'t have a relationship with an ENFP to compare notes on, but I do get along astoundingly well with my brother, who is very much an ENFP. I can see how it could be very rocky, but a relationship between an INTJ and an ENFP would seem to me to be one of adjusting. The ENFP has to adjust to the bluntness of an INTJ to understand that the INTJ isn\'t being blunt to be mean. The INTJ also has to adjust to be more tactful and careful with said bluntness. I\'m horribly blunt, and make no apologies for pointing out flaws, but my brother has helped me understand how to be more considerate of others feelings in my evaluations. Breaking past the rocky parts, the two compliment each other extraordinarily well.', 'I have to be married to have sex. It is just my upbringing, and my religious belief system. I want the person I make love to - to be the one that loves me back, forever.', ""I don't appreciate the negative generalizations about INTJ girls and I think that they're the result of misunderstandings. We have a lot of layers and they are all parts of us so maybe that's why a much more opened and sharing ENFP could think that we're pretending. I had a short but intense relationship with an ENFP guy once. I loved talking to him, he pushed my out of my comfort zone and the sex was amazing. Unfotunately we had completely different interests and ambitions and even though he didn't care about that I did. I also didn't appreciate his constant 'drama' and the need to be the center of attention. However, I would love to try a relationship with an ENFP again, just with one that shares my interests."", 'We should all not generalize on the basis of a few experiences.

I saw him standing in the corner to himself just taking in the emotions of all the people around him. I approached him and he immediately started a conversation about philosophy seeing that I was wearing a theology shirt. I don't even remember saying hi to the birthday girl because we had the most amazing first unintentional brodate. We sat in the middle of the part completely bifurcating the conversation in our own bubble. At the end of the meal I told him he is coming to Korea with me and I am hiring him to my academy.

I can talk about this forever but as an ENTP I would rather communicate in person because typing is tedious."", ""Sort of. I had a mostly online relationship with a fellow INFJ that resulted in some insanely hot sex and a curiously enduring friendship.

The reasons for this are beyond me... however, I think it is because it becomes easier to understand something in a binary spectrum. so, thoughts?', ""On the contrary, as an NT I tend to see mostly gray in situations, and often find myself arguing both sides of a debate or struggling to take a strong position on topics. I'm an INTP, so perhaps that's one of the differences between our two types.

So, would it then be the Judgement part of the personality type( that's responsible for binary thinking)?"", 'I\'m going off the definition of dicotomous thinking to mean seeing things in either black or white and I\'m not sure it\'s something universal to intjs. I actually enjoy playing devils advocate (as an evil mastermind is prone to do I guess). I am inclined to believe there is inevitably only one conclusion but that two individuals can come to different conclusions while still sticking strictly to logic. But one conclusion will be proven wrong or adapted when these two individuals meet. So my answer is maybe?

I've had to work with being abnormally sensitive so although it's a human thing I think INFJs experience the confusion or battle between mind, heart and gut a lot more intensely.\n\nI think we have to work harder at balancing the three. Ultimately bringing union to all of them so they work together in creating / guiding us in the directions we want to go vs. each voicing it's own agenda and bickering over which path to take.\n\nI've experienced where there are times where I need to follow practical/logical guidance using my mind, emotional guidance / connection using my heart and gut guidance using my body to guide me or tell me what's going on. It's kind of like driving a stick shift (which I hate), different gears are needed to get you from point A to B.\n\nHope this helps! From a fellow fish.

I like the metaphor of the stick shift, and will keep that in mind.\n\nADH73 raised the issue of the need to pay attention to the heart, and cyxu how it can be a challenge to understand the emotions lurking there. That is the problem. i find the heart to be the most challenging area for me when life is complicated and stressful. I think mind and gut both rise to the front when needed as coping/making sense mechanisms. Maybe this is an evolutionary question! maybe the heart is just a vague area in terms of purpose! So how should we be guided by hearts...what does that even mean to you?

I m not a scientist on the matter so I gues these hormones get triggered by stimulation from incentives from both outside and inside the body?\nTo support this with an example: I' ve done a good guided meditation. It was to bring back emotions from sad memories in the past. I have learned it is possible to take away the emotional load by meditation. By bringing my awareness (or focus) to the sad event, the emotional load dropped significantly.\n\nSo in that context I wonder what you would like discribe as the heart?\n\nThen we are left with gut, I dont have a clear definition on that yet. Again, I think it could be seen as a combination of instincts (hormones) and the unconscious of our minds. I believe it is possible, also by meditation to bring unconscious thoughts up to your conscious.\nSo somehow I would say, the three relate.\n\nI'm not an expert on meditation, far from that ! I only did one guided meditation. At first I didn't even believe in it. So I did get my proof. I wonder if there are different ways than meditation to create the same effect?\n\nSo I hope this made any sense. :P\nI can agree on your point that there will be an evolutionary explenation on this subject. If someone else would like to add or disagree with me? :)\n\n\nNice question, it really made me think :D\n"", ""Again you offer a good reminder Qiwi, that emotions and instincts are also functions of the mind. It still seems to make sense to speak of them metaphorically as located in the 'heart' and 'gut' because of the physicality of these sensations. Apparently ancient Egyptians thought the heart was the seat of consciousness, which makes me wonder if they felt themselves thinking from that area! All of these areas of experience are probably part of the general nervous system. So, I better clarify that I mean rationality vs emotions vs instincts, whatever their origin. I think that emotions might be more frilly than the others because they are not about survival but about desires, fears, hopes, fulfillment of the self. Qiwi, your guided meditation sounds very interesting.

Rational people usually have a lot more patients and a good way to explain to people why they are doing something wrong. Guardians are good at saying what people do wrong but are less capable to tell what you could do instead and have less patients. I might be generalising again here. Idealists are warm and accepting and Artisans are optimistic, warm and frequently impulsive. The breaktrough came when she freaked out on me once because I "" talked about her behind her back"" . I talked with a friend about what "" type "" she could be. Just like I did with other people. So yes it was behind her back if she wants to see it that way. The tone which she used, was one where a boss is blaming the staff the rates are bad and the people should work harder. At least that\'s the impression she made on me. She was definitely bossing me. I don\'t listen to people who talk to me in that way :D .\nShe acts the same way as one of my aunts. On familie parties she regularly stands with her arms crossed, scanning the area. When something has to be done, she commands one of the younger nephews to dress the table, to clean a room ... Every familie reunion the same thing :o\n\nThis are my personal experiences and interpretations of the ESTJ which, hopefully can improve.\n\nWhen I talk in my usualy way I use a lot of exaggerations, emotions, facial expressions. I started paying attention to your typing. It is a lot \'to the point\' and arouses less emotions when reading. That might be the reason ESTJ\'s in general won\'t like my talking.

Or even on here, you could just do a search for ISTPs, and scroll through the photos."", ""haha yeah I've done that on the internet but a lot of sites and forums don't agree with the same type on a person. scrolling true the ISTP's here is a good idea as a starting point, thanks :D"", 'I think Socionics might have some kind of system on trying to match people\'s looks and their ""type""; I believe a part of the theory is based off Jung\'s work so you should be in familiar territory, MBTI and all.', ""I'm confused as to what you are looking for. I turned up ISTP when I had to take the Myers Briggs through work many years ago. On here I didn't choose the right letters but I should have, once I read the description. Anyway, maybe I can help you if you can tell me what you're asking for."", ""Hehe I posted this quiet some time ago. The best way to actually get to know ISTP's is join the facebook group and ask questions. With a little luck there pop up a few that actually talk haha ! ISTP's like direct talk. They like our enfp subtileness too but when you actually want to know something, direct approach is advised lol. It takes quiet some time till they open up! When posting this I had a certain girl in mind. She kind of opened up today :D . They usually don't start the conversation because strategicly they think the other person should xD . I hope I'll get to the point where this changes. I don't like that it has to come from one side."", 'LOL!!!

I'm an artist (illustrator) so I'm often mistaken for an ISFP at first glance. It's once you've gotten to know me that the T sticks out.\n\nBest place to find us? Well, I suppose it depends on the ISTP's individual interests. I'll use myself as an example: I like art and do not like crowded, overly loud areas (aka night clubs), so I can be found at an art supply store, a small, intimate bar, or inside a library if I'm not busy. Or, I'll be walking around just for the hell of it, casually observing everything and everyone around me.\n\nSorry to revive the thread, but I figured I'd post something that hopefully may be of some help."", 'Hi, I\'m here!\nErr, You can usually find us under the bonnet of a car.... well that\'s where I usually am!

You\'d probably notice us by the untidy desk (at work), untidy bedroom, house etc. You know you\'ve met one when we say ""I will do it in a minute"", then one year later or even later, that wine glass that you were supposed to have cleared up, has finally grown mould on it, but you have now washed it up...

126,166,ENFP - ISTP interaction,"[""according to some ISTP discriptions, ISTP's dont pay attention to their feelings. Is it possible ENFP's can read the emotional state of the ISTP even when he/she isn't aware of them? I think I experianced this once and the ISTP was telling me the contrary of what I interpreted. That doesn't mean I interpreted wrong , right? :D"", 'Hmm, well I tried commenting on the update of your comment but it seemed to cut off my message, so I\'ll post here instead:\n\nI can\'t speak as an ISTP, but I can say from my own experience as an introvert that I can be aware of my feelings on one level (i.e. an intuition of something being or feeling wrong) while simultaneously being unable to express what is wrong to myself or others. And in the second sense, I was neither in control of nor aware of the feeling, or at least its source. Some people can pick up on that better than others (maybe you could more easily) through tone, facial expressions, eye contact, etc., even when I\'m saying something to the contrary. And in that case it\'s not that I\'m lying about how I feel, because there\'s also a sense of politeness or rightness about how one should be feeling, and that can dictate what one says, regardless of a true inner state. For instance I might say I don\'t mind something because I believe that I shouldn\'t be angry about it and it would be unreasonable to be angry about it, while at the same time experiencing true frustration. Not wanting someone to think I was mad at them, I would simply say it didn\'t matter to me, which is often true of my ""reasoning"" brain if not for the ""emotional"" one.\n\nBut to get back to the point, I guess I would just use your judgment of their emotions with discretion. Just because you sense what they\'re feeling (and may or may not be correct about it) doesn\'t mean they think they actually feel that way, or that they think they should feel that way. I think it\'s worth bringing up with them and seeing if your judgment matches their perception, or if they can dig deeper and see if your analysis fits. That may take time for them to process it. Hope this helps. Does my description resonate with anyone else? Have you experienced this yourself or seen it in others?', 'Yeah , I\'m not accusing them for lying. I have that too that I\'m not knowing what I feel or my brain is telling me how I should feel when instead I should just be observing. I think both sensors and feelers can pick up these inner states of a person. In my experiance eye contact and facial expression is a strong one. When I wrote this topic, it was mainly feeling, which is new to me.\nI agree with acting on discretion. I\'m not sure judgment is the right word, the mind will have done the processing but I dont know yet where the ""sensing/feeling"" came from. I also think its worth bringing these ""things"" up and checking them in a discrete way. I\'ll post if i have something new on this :D']","['Creators', 'Personality', 'ISTP - Crafter']",ISTP - Crafter
127,167,INTJ - INFJ couple,"[""Im an INFJ married to an INTJ... Our marriage has never been what I call great or close, but in the last few years we don't seem to connect anymore, not without a counselor to help my wife see my point of view...\n\nOther than regular, extensive (& expensive) therapy, would you other INTJ's have any recommendations?"", ""Sorry to hear that.\nYou can't hardly force an INTJ into your point of views, altough, as an INFJ you might go deep to the roots of the problems by yourself and understand what are the reasons. Dig for reasons, not point of views, and most of all talk to her about them.\nBe the ghost writer of this digging story."", ""From an MBTI standpoint then that is a relationship that could be considered a disappointment or upsetting.\n\nBoth are Ni doms so we start on the same place which can be really exhilarating, but then we judge things completely differently; the INTJ with Te first then Fi and the INFJ with Fe first and then Ti.\nThis leads to a situation where both can get extremely upset or annoyed as they try to figure out where the other person's (because yes, we 9/10 times blame the other person for misunderstandings) thinking went wrong.\nThis is upsetting due to how both INFJs and INTJs begin to think about something in the same manner, but then walk different paths as it enters the judging phase.\n\nYour INTJ wife will always see things from a logically objective and ethically subjective perspective and you will always see things from an ethically objective and logically subjective way.\nI've also observed that Fe and Te often try to force others to fit their way of thinking. This causes another annoyance as your Fe rubs her Fi the wrong way and her Te rubs your Ti the wrong way.\nThis will be a constant thing.\n\nI've had a close INFJ friend and even there as a friend we would often misunderstand each other even tho we enjoyed talking. Sometimes however, what she saw as no big deal hit me like knife in my Fi and really damaged our friendship and some things I did with my Te did the same thing, but milder to her Ti and ofc. values.\n\nIt's never impossible tho as there's a lot of things that are on a person-to-person basis as MBTI is just about how you process information really. But considering that you go the therapy for your relationship then it is unlikely to get better. Sorry."", ""I'm not an INTJ, but in my experience, getting a T to see from an F's perspective can be greatly assisted through meditation, and Buddhist practices. I'm sure that there are other practical solutions, too, but I have a lot of personal experience with this, and it's been remarkably helpful."", ""Trying to get an NT to change their way of thinking is a headache and a half. Being that INTJs are arguably the most independent of the types, this might be especially difficult. What's important is to emphasize the rational/logical nature of your viewpoints, and to explain precisely why you hold them so dearly. If they come from a very personal place or experience, or you've given them a lot of consideration and thought, explain this to your wife. I have a lot of respect for people's POVs, especially if they've come about through lots of reflection and analysis.\n\nBasically, if it's thoughtfully determined and rational, it'll stick. Come at your explanations from that angle and see if she better understands where you're coming from. Props to you for working on this; good luck to you."", 'Hello FictionWriter,\n\nI am sorry to hear that you have such difficulty connecting with your wife.\nI would like to bring some empirical evidence gathered through a previous relationship\nwith a male INTJ, to explain how it may seem that there is a difficulty in communicating.\nI believe previous of the points that have been presented by other posters are valid,\nespecially the advice considering the fact that, when in search of mutual understanding, several factors must be taken into account.\nThe primary consideration is to understand that cognitively, your language of mental expression differs whether it is primarily focused on reason, or emotion.\nMy best advice in this present situation, for bridging the F/T gap, is to use intuition as a foundation to rationalize your emotion.\nThis is not about justifying to her the way you feel, or validating your point of view as dominant over hers, of course. It is about contracting a consensual understanding of the equal quality of both reason and emotion.\nWhen I was with an INTJ, there would be times where he could get very worked up emotionally about me defending ""irrational"" point of views, our primary argument revolving around the famous ""egoist/altruist"" loophole of love, where he would despise my idealistic altruist approach on love, while he would accept much gladly my own.\nAnyhow, we would use philosophy as a mean to connect on our Fe/Fi differences, and while his emotions were internalized, and only visible as ""a silver lining"" to a cynical approach on love, I would have the perceptive judgment sufficient to seize the beauty of a compliment in a passive-aggressive reproach.\nIn other words, emotionally speaking, INTJs are very sparse, crypted yet meaningful. Though it may feel abysmal and voided to fall into the depth of their internal feelings, with very little emotional ground to work onto -such as an Fe would provide- it\'s about learning to fly in the dark... In that experience, I believe that I learnt from that man to understand the silence, absence of expressed (internal) feelings, as a testimony to the nothingness that there was to critique in our relationship.\nIn other words, he would let me know, in fact very passionately, when something was wrong, or he wasn\'t agreeing to an idea, or value I expressed. Communication was used primarily to exchange ideas, - that would channel my feelings, and I could ""feed off"" the stimulation he exerted when using his Te, though very aggressively and dominantly. It was also used to solve conflicts, mostly reason/emotion conundrums where I\'d let him rant off about certain topics, or ideas that I sometimes would defend for the sake of ""pushing his buttons"".\nDon\'t mistake me, I really valued his intellect, and only saw this type of interactions as ways to train him to express his ideas in a more paced, social way.\nRarely, I would be blessed with certain ""shooting stars"" of emotionally-direct interactions, when he would offer me food, (how primitive, yet touching!), or when he would act very possessive and jealous (though it was unhealthy behavior, it showed deeper positive concern to my condition).\nFrom those starting points, I would make sure to actually have a conversation about each of his communication attempts, in a very meta-conversational way, in order to positively reinforce these behaviors, by acknowledging him, and reassuring him.\nI think most of the people believe NTs to be narcissistic, and egoist in the sense that the only way to access to their inner world is to compliment their intelligence. Actually, proceeding this way would only lead the INTJ to ""feel"" as a science guinea pig, in the sense that they are only providing for an internal account of intelligence, and in no sense acting self-centered. I think it\'s only fair to acknowledge their interior feelings, and the fact that it is much more existent, and important to them that it is generally thought, if we expect them to do the same for our extraverted feelings.\nWhile I experienced this relationship with this INTJ in a very premature age of my life -late teens-, I will always consider carefully how much I have learnt in terms of communication skills, and inter-personal understanding just by spending some time with him.\n\nThanks for reading, don\'t hesitate to further the discussion :)\n\n', ""For me the biggest issue with Te vs Fe is it feels like Extroverted Feelers are trying to make me feel the same way they do when they're sharing how they feel about a topic which doesn't work for me. If I've become emotionally arrested by a topic like abortion or the death penalty I'm going to internalize it because I feel like how I reach a conclusion and what conclusion I make really will define to me who I am as a person. The same with the definition of intimacy. It's not just sex or milestones, it's a surprising kiss or conversation, because it redefines everything in the relationship while sex or relationship milestones are usually more planned out. It's a hard sell for me when people say sex is the most precious experience two people can have together.\nUltimately just because an INTJ prefers to rely on their Te doesn't mean they don't have feelings. They just digest feelings slowly and not at all if it's an option because (for me at least) it's a lot of work.\nI'm thinking for romantic relationships the issue between an INFJ and an INTJ is more the Fe vs Fi rather than Te vs Fe. We live in a competitive world so INFJs have a lot more motivation to develop their Ti and work things out rationally as often as possible but philosophy, ethics, ideals all get thrown in the bin of things you don't need to waste tax dollars on so Fi doesn't get as much room to grow in the typical education system.\nI can't imagine the two of you getting married if you never felt close to each other so try to see where the communication is getting fuzzy. Maybe you're associating one feeling after another and assuming she sees the connection between the two emotions when she doesn't.\nThat's all I can think of without any details. I hope that helps. Give more specifics if you can."", 'Could you find out your and partner\'s astrological mars, venus, moon, and sun sign?\n\nI\'m a mars fire sign. I get bored when there\'s no challenge or when I can predict the actions or course of my partner. But since my sun and venus are both Capricorn I don\'t cheat, but my mars fire sign makes me feel that sexual urge to cheat. I suppress it and it then makes me feel unhappy and recluse from my partner. In my experience some adrenaline and an adventure helps alleviate the pent up mars in scorpio energy. Also, flirting with others sometimes helps. If you figure these aspects it may lead to a solution after contemplation.\n\nMy goodness, I hate finding some truth in astrology. Why did I ever get bored and research it one day? It seems so not credible. Mars signs are how you fight. Venus signs are how you love.

I am considering majoring in physics, because I love the idea componenet. However, I was looking at the break-down of what made me INFP and it said it was just that I valued compassion. Now I actually took this test when I was younger and came out INTP, but again like you some events transpired and now I\'m scoring INFP.

It is opinion that Germany is awesome. (It\'s a fact that Germany is awesome :) ) People like me have a very difficult time expressing their emotion. If you\'re trying to start a relationship with an istj be sure that you let them grow toward you. I have an ex girlfriend who I broke up with because she wanted to hang out every second of every day. It\'s welcome to a point but afterwards it gets annoying. Complement istj personality types on their dedication. We like to feel needed. If I tell anyone that something is getting done, it is getting done. Period. Mention that. Well your point 3 is just kind of answered. Do some research.

And though it might seem cute at first, eventually it will wear us down. This is particularly difficult with ENFPs because they're so open ended and at the same time they're in tune with their feelings. So they'll know they're not happy but they might not know what will make them happy. At least with FJs we know where the goal post is. INTPs need emotional goals to be good at relationships. We need to know what a good relationship is, in order to have one. It doesn't just 'happen'.

I think the fact that I'm independent helped, we went to separate universities and maintained a loving relationship despite the distance. I think this was because he was a completely stable, constant, and kind person. He loved me, I was his person, and that was enough for him. And I had the freedom to go out and flirt and party (innocently) to my heart's content, which is how I communicate, and he never minded as long as I was coming home to him.\n\nThese are just some random musings really. As to how we got to know each other, I'm not sure as we had no common interests apart from food! But we were at school together so there's that. I remember 'chasing' him because he didn't realise I liked him, even though everyone else did. We used to talk for hours and hours before we got together.

I do that with friends online when we can't meet: we listen to an album together, start it at the exact same time, and discuss it while enjoying our food for Ears.\nIt can be as precise in the vocabulary as you want, the only important thing is to discuss point of views :)\nIntro, Statement, Opening... Hope the most structured profiles won't snob this :)\n\nPS: Excuse my French, but this website doesn't like quotes: &amp;amp;amp;quot;..."", ""I don't really listen to whole albums, but one I've heard most of recently is Conditions's Full of War. Really great, has a very life-instructive tone, feels like something that would be on required listening list in high school, if there ever was such a thing. :)"", 'Currently listening to ""40 Mark Strasse"" by The Shins (heard it in my yoga class yesterday).\n\nI cannot stress this enough: Everyone should listen to Keane. Everyone. Keane is a glorious English band that has a song for any feeling you\'ve ever felt, ever.\n\nIt\'s like the tagline ""There\'s an app for that."" Keane has a song for that. Need a good ""You Can Do It"" vibe? There\'s a song for that! Feeling neglected by a friend or lover? There\'s a song for that! Worried about your impact on the world? There\'s a song for that! Angry with your country for their involvement with religious warfare? There\'s a song for that! Nostalgic about your hometown? There are like seven million songs for that!\n\nAh, Keane. Gotta love \'em.', 'Beck - Bottle of Blues\nStormtroopers of Death - Kill All the @$$holes\nSlayer - Overt Enemy\nNatalie Merchant - Carnival\nDead Kennedys - Holiday in Cambodia', ""I don't tend to listen to entire albums either. I certainly couldn't think of five to list, but I can name at least one - Gojira - 'L'Enfant Sauvage' - amazing album from an amazing band for those who enjoy death metal. I've also been enjoying quite a lot of songs from Lorde lately... Come to think of it, with the amount of songs I have of hers downloaded I may just have her whole album without even realising it, so I'll go ahead and name Lorde - 'Pure Heroine' as another."", 'I listen to a wide range of heavy metal, punk, and political activist music. Oddly enough whenever I feel really angry, frustrated, or down right depressed when I listen to music with the same tone calms me down and keeps me on the level; it also keeps my mind occupied from other really negative thoughts. Here are my top 5 favorite singers and the bands they belong to with a couple song choices for each.\n\n1. Serj Tankian (System of a Down) - Deafening Silence, Gate 21\n2. Tim McIlrath (Rise Against) - Restless World, What Are We Gonna Do\n3. Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine) - Until The End, Alone Without You\n4. Immortal Technique - Leaving the Past, Sign of the Times\n5.

142,186,Some of my Poetry: The Water Molecule,"['The Water Molecule\nCopyright Â© 2004\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nOnce there was a molecule\nA molecule\nA molecule!\nOnce there was a molecule of water!\n\nAnd then it flew!\nThis molecule\nAnd then it flew\nThru a cloud or two.\n\nIt went right up\nAnd up and down\nIt went right up\nThru a cloud.\n\nAnd round and round\nThis molecule gazed around\nA cloud that frowned\nThen down it went, to the ground.\n\nIt said ""Oh my! Oh my!""\nThe molecule was picked right up\nIn a drop! A drop of rain\n""What am I to gain?"" exclaimed the molecule\n\nAnd round and round\nThe drop of rain it flew\nThru a cloud or two\nAnd round the drop of rain it flew.\n\nQuoth molecule:\n""If precipitation is my pension,\nHelp me escape this surface tension!""\nThe molecule had to mention!\n\nUp and down and round and round!\nThe drop of rain it flew\nthen toward the ground\nIt spun around.\n\n""Oh no! Oh no!\nWhat am I to do! to do!""\nSaid the molecule in its plight\n""Stop this crazy hydro-flight!""\n\nThen the wind it came right out\nAnd blew and blew\nThe drop of rain\nIt blew the drop of rain to the sky!\n\nThe drop of rain, cold as ice\nFroze that day, into hail\n""Oh great, this is nice""\nSaid the molecule who wished to bail.\n\n""Wonderful, now I\'m stoned""\nThe molecule now bemoaned\n""Who will ever rescue me?""\nThen the hailstone hit a tree.\n\n""Hey you broke my twig!""\nSaid the tree who grew a fig\n""Until you fell it was quite big!""\nThe molecule danced a jig.\n\nFor it had been wrestled free!\nFrom the grasp of the stone\nUpon impact it was thrown\nIt now had to make its plee!\n\n""Don\'t bemoan your broken limb!""\nSaid the molecule with a grin\n""Maybe you needed a trim,\nAnd now you look quite slim!""\n\nThen the sun it came out that day\nWhen the clouds went their way\nTossed about by the gale\nWisps of sky that are quite frail.\n\nAt this point I do demarcate\nWould the molecule evaporate?\nWith a smile I relate to you\nThe molecule became some dew.', 'The http://www.air-huarache.co.uk/ wind,

fate.\n\nHiding from within its cloud\nPosition is completely shroud\nIf you know the exact speed\nWhere it went none can heed.\n\nQuantum is as Quantum does\nFrom Atomic giant to querky Quark\nAll

flighty Fermion\nIs indeed the E-lectron!\nAnd its partner you'd have guessed\nIs a proton in its hadron vest.\n\nPositron in Positronium\nSpining round its Electronium\nIf they get too

145,189,Don Juan syndrome (i.e. male promiscuity),"['http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Juanism\n\nI don\'t know if I\'m just tired and it\'s late but I find the last sentence in my quote below to be a profound psychological insight.\n\n""Presenting Symptoms: The first time a man of 60, whom we will call Frederick, came to see me, he announced he had decided to break up his marriage, even though it had lasted for 41 years. His wife was in agreement. They had three children, all married and happy. He had been 19 and she 17 when they were married, after an experimental period of normal and satisfying sexual relations. During his marriage he had many casual love affairs, all marked by inhibitions in sexual activity. ?˜I was?? he said, ?˜as one spell-bound.??And he became ?œa prey to sexual obsessions??- a Don Juan - until he met a young married woman in her thirties. This encounter was at first only one amusing event among others, till one day he suddenly had ?˜a kind of revelation?? this was the woman he had always been seeking. (Later on, we became aware that what he had been seeking for such a long time was a being whom, because he was unable to master himself, he could dominate completely.)""\n\nPassage is the starting paragraph from the article &amp;amp;quot;A Don Juan on His Way to Wisdom&amp;amp;quot; by Gilberte Aigrisse from the Journal of Analytical Psychology.\n\nAnyone (of any gender) feel free to comment with your thoughts and opinions on the passage and topic - or better yet your experiences on male promiscuity, of course on whatever level you feel comfortable to share.', ""Last sentence same. As much as I like to be independent useful and some manner of a provider for my significant other I'd would really want them to have some sort of almost unspoken hold over. Despite what I might verbalize interally I want to have no qualms about submitting to my lover...whomever they may be..."", ""although to be honest I'm not that promiscuous...not that I'm not trying to be.""]","['Dating & Relationships', 'Sex']",Sex
146,190,I'd like to ask a question y'all,"['So I meet this INFJ friend and we used to be so close like brother n sister\nRecently he-this best friend, ditched me because of my ""negativity"" and how I treated him like an emotion dumpster. I mean, that wasn\'t me all the time, and don\'t friends all do it to each other?\nHe also implicated that I never click with him as a friend, while we spent a ridiculous amount of time around each other for the last year. This is extremely hurtful.\nAnd so I was like you wanna cut the tie, fine. What\'s more confusing is that he\'s still acting like we are close friends. Every time he interacts with me it just reminds me of how unimportant I am to him.\nSo looks like Im just a supporting role in this farce he has composed. My conscience and rationality keep telling me to leave, but somehow its just so hard to cut a part of me.', ""guess I'm not makin a single point here..\nalright Im kinda wondering whats working his mind"", ""First, I don't really understand exactly what you're asking about, other than the rhetorical question in the second sentence there's no real question its just you venting which is fine, we all need to let it out at times. Secondly, it shows you're impatient as you expected someone to respond to you in under 5 minutes between posting and replying when at a time maybe no one was here or people are still giving it some thought.\n\nFrom what I'm seeing is that he just needed to vent too; however, at this point you're just letting it build up until it blows up again and the next time may be even worse. I'm not saying break ties with him completely at this moment, but find some private time with just the two of you away from everyone else. Ask him about things you have said to him, before that conversation that broke you apart, and get his feelings on it, understand how he felt on the things you've told him; calmly if possible, don't let the frustration take over. Then you in turn open up to him on things he has said to you and how you felt about it, let him know what you go through without raising your voice.\n\nIf you can't reconcile after that then walk away without angst towards each other, just let go. If you can get along after then try to find each other's boundaries, how far you can go before it gets too far. This part may sound weird but have a safety word, something funny that you both never say in your daily life, once that word is spoken you know you hit that boundary and know when to stop.

It may seem contradictory but much like TimidTraveler said you're gonna have to reconcile it with him. You'll most likely have to make the first approach but as long as you're honest with him about your view of the relationship, where it may have gone wrong and his importance to you as a friend; he should start to feel comfortable enough to open up the dialogue and get this sorted out."", 'Brothers and sisters sometimes fight and are mean to each other right?

147,191,"The terms ""logos"" and ""eros"" (long quote, be","['This thread could just as easily go into Philosophy sub-forum but I put it in Psychology because my quote is from a psychology book.\n\nThe terms logos and eros are terms often used in Analytical Psychology as well as in other circles; but, usually one finds these terms used generally or as umbrella terms with no specific definition.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros_(concept)\n\nI found a great comprehensive and lengthy quote on the terms I thought was worth sharing:\n\n""Now these two forces represent a fundamental opposition. In the examples discussed in the preceding chapter, the first was equated to the reasonable factor, which enables a man [human being] to recognize and accept an impartial standard. The second was equated to the unreasonable and dynamic factor, which compels a man to deny any possibility that his own experience or point of view might be fallacious and make him declare: \'It is that way, and that is the right way it is!\' He cannot concede even that modicum of relativity which would allow him to say, \'That is the way I see it,&amp;quot; recognizing that someone that may see it differently.\n\nThese two forces operate in every one of us, and if we are to travel the road leading towards consciousness and individuation, we must each sooner or later face the problem created by their fundamental opposition. For one represents the rational attitude to life, the form-creating relation, which on the human level is the product of ego consciousness, of scientific thought and of logic, while on the cosmic or universal level it is expressed as the law of God or the logos. The other represents dynamic energy, formless and goalless, quite devoid of logic, being, as we say, irrational - following only the \'ratio\' of nature, as water does, or wind or fire. On the human level it is emotion, especially emotionality, panic, rage, passion. In its unconditioned, daemonic, or divine aspect it is that principle, called eros* by the Greeks, which \'binds together and delivers\' - the principle of dynamic relatedness. Or it could be called the blind urge of instinct. Kundalini, the serpent power that, according to the teachings of Tantric Buddhism, lies coiled up at the root of all psychic life, dormant in unawakened instinct.\n\nWhen an individual becomes aware of forces so fundamentally opposed operating in his own life, motivating him in his attitudes and actions, the ensuing conflict may be so severe as to paralyze his every effort.. When he says yes to the rational tendency and represses the other, it may look like that right decision; everything appears quite in order, and it seems as if he had reached a satisfactory solution of the problem. But the the rest goes out of living, and he begins to feel depressed or suffocated. If he takes the opposite course and says yes to the dynamic urge, courting the emotions and yielding himself to what D.H. Lawrence calls the \'flow,\' his life may come alive; but then he finds himself seized by a panic fear of being carried away into all kinds of excesses, or into strange regions of inner experience where he can no longer make an adequate contact with his fellow men, where perhaps he will not be able to make himself understood at all.\n\nThe extent of the distress and pain caused by a conflict of this character can hardly be realized by anyone who has not experienced such a state. The validity of everything the individual does seems to be destroyed. He may attempt to resolve the dilemma by following the reasonable and logical way, building his house foursquare, taking into account all sides of any situation, so far as he can see them, and ruling out every other consideration. This course of action may seem to work for a while, a few days perhaps or even a few weeks; then it goes stale or is threatened by some extraneous influence - his wife\'s irrationality, for instance, or he may be seized by a quite unreasonable emotional outburst that yet obviously holds value, possible something of the value of the completeness of himself. He may feel more or at one with himself while acting in this irrational fashion than he did when measuring his actions with care, and he says to himself: \'When I go with this impulse, I feel whole.\' But shortly a doubt arises as to where this irrational impulse may lead. \'Is it not just arrant selfishness,\' he asks himself, \'to follow my own desires in this way?\' He begins to wonder what all the self-controlled, disciplined leaders he has always admired would say to such \'self-indulgence.\' And so he swings back to the constraints of accepted law and order, burdened still further by a sense of guilt at his defection.\n\nThe conflict has been described here as if it were conscious, but it is not necessarily so. More usually, the battle goes on in a subterranean place and almost completely unrecognized, the sufferer being aware only of the stultifying effects it has on his life and not at all of the conflict itself as a psychological or moral problem. Under such circumstances it will probably break through into the conscious life under the guise of physical symptoms - actual paralysis sometimes, or less serious illness, such as severe headaches having a paralyzing effect. Sometimes the difficulty may show itself completely unknown to the individual, who suffers from unexplained depressions or from inertia and fatigue, which prevent him from accomplishing anything: every attempt at activity requires a herculean effort that has a nightmarish quality, as in that not uncommon dream in which one is unable to move because one\'s feet are too heavy to be raised or so light that they can get no grip on the ground. Indeed, a conflict of this sort can produce an almost complete paralysis of life.\n\nWhere the situation is more conscious than in either of this foregoing instances, the sufferer is aware that his difficulty is due to an inner conflict, although he is unable to make clear to himself the precise nature of the values that are opposed in him, or so to disentangle them that he can make a valid choice. Naturally there are many different ways in which the values of life can divide into irreconcilable opposites. The opposition between the rational attitude and the dynamic one is a very common expression of the impasse. In political terms it takes the form of the right versus the left, or the conservative versus the revolutionary. In religion it becomes the schism of the Catholic as against the Protestant point of view, or the question of formalism as against mysticism - as Paul puts it, of works or grace - while in everyday life it sets the plodding scientific attitude in contrast to creative flight. There are of course innumerable other lines of cleavage - extraversion versus introversion, the individual versus the collective aim, material versus spiritual values - any one of which may posit the insoluble dilemma and bring life to a standstill.\n\nWhen this happens, the problem of what to do about these contradictory, seemingly irreconcilable factors has to be faced, for it is undeniable that both are indwellers of the kingdom of the psyche. They are actually more than indwellers: they are organic components of it, making up perhaps the majority element and wielding greater power than the reasonable and conscious minority. If the psyche is not to be a house divided against itself, which obviously could not stand, some means of reconciling the opposites must be sought.\n\nThe conflict between the conscious and the unconscious elements has been taken as illustration because it is obvious and well recognized by anyone with even a modicum of psychological insight; it is not, however, the sole or even the most difficult aspect of the problem. For the daemonic energy manifested in the motion aroused by the point at issue, and represented or personified by one of the archetypes, is not single but dual. In the archetypes the urges of the unconscious have not as yet been differentiated, for differentiation is a function of consciousness. therefore they appear in ambiguous or dual form, in fact as pairs of opposites - as good-bad, favorable-harmful, spiritual-demonic, and so on through the whole range of possible dichotomies. The fundamental opposition may similarly be represented by other irreconcilable pairs such as male-female, yang-yin, sun-moon, animate-inanimate. This inner duality of the nonpersonal energy awakened by the life situation is not a matter of merely of philosophical or academic interest. To the individual torn by conflict it is of the deepest concern, even a life-and-death issue; for until he can find some way of reconciling the opposition within himself, his life will remain suspended and his soul will be a battleground.\n\nIn attempting to resolve a fundamental psychological conflict, a thorough survey of the problem at the conscious level must first be undertaken. If this approach does not yield a satisfactory solution, it will be necessary to scrutinize the unconscious data [dreams, fantasies, etc.] for further evidence as to the cause of the difficulty and also for the guidance as to its solution. When this course is followed, it is usually found that factors reaching beyond the the personal life of the individual are involved. For example, the opposition inherent in the conflict may be bound up with or represented by the two parents, who - apart from their individual characters and temperaments, which may or may not be in accord - have of necessity a certain incompatibility, from the child\'s point of view, owing to the fact that they are of opposite sex. Yet if the child is to become an individual in his own right, he must find some way of amalgamating the essential qualities of both parents existing within him; for each is part of the very stuff of his being. This is a problem with which every child has to deal, and the task may prove a difficult one even when the parents have somewhat similar tastes and temperaments. When, however as not infrequently happens, the parents married not because of their likeness but because of their dissimilarity, being attracted to each other by their very difference, the child\'s problem will be severe, especially if neither parent has worked to assimilate psychologically the values represented by the partner.\n\nIn such a situation the child will probably identify himself with one parent; he will love, admire, emulate everything that this parent does and is, and will turn away from the other. Jung states the case most trenchantly when, writing of the child negatively related to the mother, he says: \'The leitmotif of this type is: Anything whatever, so long as it is not like Mother!\'** Or, if the child\'s positive feeling goes to the mother, the corresponding negative feelings of resentment and resistance, even of hate, may devolve upon the father. A markedly negative attitude to the the parents is particularly apt to develop when there is lack of harmony between them, and inevitably produces serious psychological results. In such families the husband and wife may each ascribe to the other all the difficulties of the marriage and even of itself, and the projection to the partner may not stop with this. The husband represents to the wife her animus [a structural archetype of the psyche], her unknown, other side, and the wife similarly carries the projection of the husband\'s anima [a structural archetype of the psyche]. Thus, if either person lacks insight regarding his own character and the less obvious contents of his psyche, he may all too readily project these to the partner: consequently he will consider the other to blame for temperamental problems and conflicts stemming in reality from his own unwholeness.\n\nWhen it is the wife who makes this massive projection, she will feel that all the misfortune of her lot derives from her husband and his family, while all its desirable factors are to be credited to her own people. Her greatest reproach to her child will be: \'You are just like your father.\' Now it goes without saying that in some respects the child probably is like his father, from whom half of his heritage comes - a fact for which the child can hardly be held responsible. But faced with the repudiation of the father\'s traits within himself, he may follow the mother\'s lead and and despise all that the father stands for, rejecting the father character not only in his own parent but in all other men as well, and, with far more devastating effects, in himself. On the other hand, the child may love his father best; then, resenting the injustice of the mother\'s accusations, he will take the opposite attitude and side with his father against her. In this event he will be compelled to champion the characteristics of the father, whether they are desirable ones or not, in season and out, to the detriment of his own critical powers.\n\nNo matter which of these attitudes the child takes, as he comes to maturity the conflict between the inharmonious parental elements within him will absorb an increasing proportion of his energy and and will hold it anchored in the unconscious.For he dare not allow himself to become aware that his chosen attitude is challenged or even contradicted bu a different set of values lying dormant within his own nature - namely, values associated with the parent whom he has elected to despise and, psychologically speaking, to repudiate. Instead he will hold to hos conscious standpoint with a tenacity not un-tinged with prejudice and fanaticism, because it stems from the unconscious root of the positive bond with the favored parent thus it necessarily exerts an autonomous and compulsive influence on his consciousness. Or it may be that even though he remains unaware of the contradictory elements within him, he allows them free play, so that they function unchecked in his daily life. He will then fall into hopeless inconsistencies, so that what he does or says today may have no connection with his actions or convictions of yesterday or of tomorrow. Obviously a life so wanting in consistency may easily come to a complete deadlock\n"" - Mary Ester Harding, Psychic Energy: Its source and its transformation ; pages 364-370\n\n*Cf. M.E.

What I mean is that the extremes of Logos could be said to be something like Strength/Learning/Growth and War/Insecurity, while the extremes of Eros could be said to be something like Confidence/Creativity/Nurture and Ignorance/Apathy. In that context, the location at which an individual would be found at any given time would be more a result of, I think, how much responsibility they willingly adopt. In this framing, they almost look like a representation of the masculine and feminine qualities of humans. My main point here is that perhaps merit can be found in the concept of the non-dual in a subject like this, that logos and eros are not in opposition and that, as with individuals with seemingly opposing traits and temperaments, the amalgamation of the seemingly opposed is another form of willfully adopting responsibility, which seems to be what bends each spectrum towards its most useful point, or at least regulates between the useful implementations of each end of a spectrum or apparent dichotomy...\n\nI'm not sure how clear what I'm trying to say is, as I'm just think-typing, but this is a really interesting subject that I think deserves to be revived despite its significant forum-age.""]","['Psychology', 'General Topics']",General Topics

Everything would have to be relearned, I as an individual will cease to exist, but it did leave me to wonder if the person that I would become next be any different than who I was previously? Would he have the same tendencies that I did, the same thought process, the mannerisms, is it wired into the brain to be that way, more importantly would this new individual see life in a way better than the way I did?\n\nI Have been on dating sites for over a year now, after 100+ messages I've had zero replies back, it's still better results than any attempts I made in person. I found one woman with the personality tag in her profile and she wanted everyone to take the test to see compatibility before contacting her. I thought it couldn't hurt to at least try, but I was thinking it be another Horoscope crap. When I took the personality test I was very skeptical about the questionnaire, I thought it was too short to come with any concrete data about a person so I searched out more like it. The same prospect each time, I found the questions very subjective, the answers you could be giving may not truly reflect what you would do in that situation, but what you think of yourself in that situation. The reality is you may do something completely different than what you originally thought would happen. It did however describe my life down to the very last details of my personal habits which pushed me to search it out further. Two weeks of web browsing and an average of 12 open tabs a day eventually led me here.\n\nI have never had a relationship my entire life though it doesn't mean I haven't tried. For the most part when I see someone I'm attracted to, the first thoughts that come to mind is complete doubt and self-loathing. The first thing in my mind is almost always why would she ever go out with me I'm just a stupid, pathetic, loser. If they return staring back at me, I avert my eyes away quickly like a creepy person would do and have been chewed out before. It furthers my inner belief that I'm worthless and it would never work out. It's not all bad, there are the few cases that I have been able to muster the courage to get near someone. In those cases I plan out what I am going to say and how I am going to do it, with some I have multiple poems lined up to give to her, but it all ends the same where I approach her and... nothing. Not a sound, not a whimper, just me staring blankly, my throat tightens, and then end up walking away completely embarrassed.\n"", ""I am a walking contradiction or so I assume. What I do in my personal life and my fantasy life are two completely different personalities.\n\n1. In video games I like being part of a group, if it's a multiplayer game I tend to be very talkative type-chat wise, I don't talk into Ventrilo or Teamspeak, but I'm very open and type frequently sharing my thoughts with anyone and everyone. I'm usually the aggressive Tank, power Healer, or the fearless supporter taking risks to help others. I prefer group interactions so joining small parties to big raids feels just as comfortable to me as being alone. Single player game it comes out about the same, I find games where you play in a group of NPC's whether I'm controlling them or they move on their own as long as my character isn't always solo. Reality check I stay away from the crowds, I don't talk to anyone unless they talk to me first even then I'm very reluctant about continuing a conversation unless I know the person to some degree. The only time I ever go into a crowded area is like at a music concert, usually with my older brother or alone. For the most part however I tend to stand or sit in the back unless its one of my favorite bands on stage then I move into the crowded areas closer up to the middle, but not anywhere near mosh pits or to the barrier and I still don't talk to anyone.\n\n2. Whenever I fantasize about having a fictional family relationship, in the fantasy I get a very good enjoyable feeling when being cuddled or held in a warm embrace by my significant other. I imagine how I would be as a father with children actively playing games with them, teaching them about the world around us, or consoling for emotional comfort. Reality is I don't like being touched for the most part, even hugging close family members is uncomfortable. Just this last week I was at a family gathering for my Aunt's birthday. I wanted to be there for her, but I felt uneasy the entire night, I avoided being in any photos or taking any photos, I stayed away from any group activities including singing happy birthday; I just wanted the night to end.\n\n3. Sexual fantasies are extremely vivid, with long unnecessary back stories with details that can go on for over an hour before getting to the sexual portion of it. It usually entails quite a bit of plot build up with progressive foreplay leading up to and continues after the climax. I will admit I have envisioned myself in both gender roles equally, but in either case I almost always see my partner as the dominant and I am the submissive. Unfortunately in reality I don't think I could put up with being in a relationship with someone who is always in a dominant role even if its just bedroom behavior, although I would like to at least try."", 'I actually ended up reading both your posts.\n\nYou should consider looking at my thread about logos and eros in the ""Psychology"" sub-forum.

Namely, they never checked their account. But even then maybe you just messaged the wrong person. I know I\'ve messaged people from whom I never got a reply only to realize sometime afterwards they were of a different sexual orientation. Personally for me, I also tend to come off as an idiot and say really stupid/weird things (at least considered weird for a introductory message) and those people never got back to me. Others times I\'ve started conversations with people and then they just dropped them; though I don\'t blame them. I mean besides the fact that I\'ve done that myself (so shouldn\'t judge) and you don\'t know the reason they dropped it (could be something going on with them) ... ultimately when it comes to ""dating"" or meeting people rejection (and yes a lot of rejection depending on how much you try) is part of the process - at least you get battle experience.\n\nAlso as an INTP I\'m disappointed you\'re not more critical of horoscopes ... come on, they\'re fun and all, but they\'re written in a general sense so they\'re made to seem relevant.\n\nYou\'re feelings of of inferiority are very typical, nothing strange or weird about them. I bet everyone (not just ""INTPs"") feels that way in varying degrees.

You don\'t like to be hugged in real life - okay but everyone needs a little hugging in life - so then what do you do? You fantasy about the hugs you\'ve missed out on.\n\nI once read the you can\'t quite (fully) assimilate the inferior function (in your case feeling). It\'s always going to remain the most undeveloped and undifferentiated because your identity is tied up with introverted thinking. So the best thing you can do with your inferior function is to adapt to it. Considering you filter reality with thinking, as in you form judgments identifying what you take in through your senses (perception); you should study up on a little theory.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Personality-C-A-Meier/dp/3856305491/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1395629580&sr=8-1&keywords=c.a.+meier+personality\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Psychotherapy-Marie-Louise-Von-Franz/dp/1570626219/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1395629600&sr=8-1&keywords=von+franz+psychotherapy\n^ Half of the book is a chapter on the inferior function.', '""Also as an INTP I\'m disappointed you\'re not more critical of horoscopes ... come on, they\'re fun and all, but they\'re written in a general sense so they\'re made to seem relevant.""\n\nI just wanted to quote a single line not the entire post, that doesn\'t seem possible.

Your Fe may never be as good as a Natural, but you'll be much happier bringing it up to a decent level. Especially when I find a girl I really like... I wnat to throw my best at her and see what happens. Knowing I did my best takes a huge weight off my shoulders.... I feel like &quot;well there was nothing more I could have done, it must be her then&quot;\n\nFor a long time I had similar issues to you, 1) I was extremely afraid / stressed to socialize with the opposite sex / people in general. 2) I had a hard time making things click because I just couldn't get excited about the same things as most people.\n\nTo fix #1) the only thing that will save you is massive amounts of progressive desensitization. Learning to improvise and going into the moment. When conversations are at their best everyone is totally in the moment not thinking. It's a play state, a flow state. Desensitizing it enough to where you bring down the noise, the fear, the stress. Taking an improv class, meditation, and anything else that makes you constantly commit to being the moment over and over. A good way to do this is to go up and talk to people, and utterly commit to talking about the first thing that pops into your head. See how long you can keep the conversation going, and how much fun you and the other person can have. At first it will most likely be complete shit. But that's okay. Over time you will calibrate yourself and things will actually pop into your head that are quite good. When you're really in the zone it'll feel like every move you make is the right move. Keep striving for that. It's mainly the fear and the thinking part of yoru brain that puts the breaks on your ability to do that. But also experience plays a role too. You'll know what works and what doesn't work over time. But there's only one way to get there... lots of trial and error :/ Eventually you'll want to become someone who is fun to be around. &quot;Laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone&quot; I'm not gonna lie though. This is extremely difficult, and can be massively ego shattering. It may be the hardest thing you ever do. But it's utterly worth it.\n\nWe INTP's are actually good at improvisation and thinking up new ideas because of Ne. We CAN get really good at conversation because of this.\n\nIf you start doing number 1, you may realize #2 starts giving you a lot of problems. Even though I can talk to a lot more people now I don't really WANT to. Most ppl are 'S' types and I find them unintersting to talk to. I really like talking to other N types and people on the same wavelength as me. But to find them I have to hunt around. And when I do find them, all my practice makes them enjoy hanging with me more. And when I do find someone who I do really click with.. I can knock a home run out of the park because I have lots of experience.\n\nI hope you figure out your path.""]","['Rationals', 'INTP - Architect', 'Personality']",INTP - Architect

I love playing story driven games or games with rpg elements that allow more control over the path you take. It's either engage me in a journey of character development or let me be the character I want to be. When I'm playing online, I find myself either playing in the support role or as the reluctant leader if no one else steps up.\n\nIf I had to recommend some of my favorite games right now, it would have to be the Bioshock series, the Portal games, and I can't put enough emphasis on how much I love both the story and multiplayer on The Last of Us."", 'Ive been Playing Hawken on steam recently.\nEdit: I forgot to mention how much I love the Metal Gear Solid Series.', ""I love video games, despite my lacking possession of a proper console, but I truly love the Assassin's Creed series. Its historical accuracy and complex storyline and belief system always makes me wish that I myself was an assassin in that world.\n\nI remember the first time I played Portal (wasn't the first one, but instead the second) was with my best friend. We were both mind blown and fascinated at the mental puzzles, which took us a few hours to complete at times. By the time we were on our second round of the game, we couldn't believe that it has taken us so long.\n\nAnother series that's a favorite of mine is the Legend of Zelda; my absolute favorite being Twilight Princess. I also enjoy the thrill whenever I play Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2; as well with Fear and the Dead Space series. These are the games that I can think of right off the top of my head. :D"", ""Bryann, Both are great but Portal 2 is definitely my favorite of the series. It is genre-bending but how many games can you play on the same screen with your friends these days? You really have to be on top of your communication and team work.. especially since it's a puzzle game. There were a few levels in there where only one of us knew what the hell was going on but it's a damn awesome game nonetheless."", ""Cloudhunt,\n\nThat's true, especially when it comes to first-person shooter games. If there's a lack of communication then people are likely to get irritated pretty quickly.\n\nWith Portal 2, though I can completely relate, when you say that only one of you knew what was going on. Haha, my friend and I were like that as well. And at other points we'd argue on who wanted to complete the puzzle. x) I agree. The game is awesome and the plot is a great twist."", ""I play SWTOR online, and I am also an avid laser tag player (though I'm a little picky about the arena I go into)... so would that be more of a sport or a game?"", 'I am a huge PC gamer, DotA 2, Assassin?™s Creed, Skyrim, LoL, Heathstone, Zelda and generally any strategy game or story driven rpg.', 'So what would you consider your playing style? How do you tend to approach challenges while gaming?', ""I'd say my gaming tastes are more on a spectrum as I don't mind playing and enjoy most of them. The top end of my spectrum would be something like rpg, adventure, and strategy games while the middle would be like shooting games and the least interesting games would be fighting and driving ones.\n\nThat said I have to say two of my all time favorite games would be Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Battlefield Bad Company 2. Some fond memories for GTA consisted of just cruising down the street with some funky music playing then once my driving got too reckless and I crashed into some car who'd try away; I'd hunt them down, pull the driver out, and try to convince him with my gun he was the reason I crashed. Naturally my attempts at persuasion ended with the police chasing me so I'd hole up in some parking-lot complex and see how long I could last until the they overwhelmed me. Some favorite moments of mine with Battlefield was of course the multiplayer; I loved loved loved not only sniping people across practically the entire map or however much distance I could gain while still having a shot but also enjoyed the fact that I had to calculate gravity, wind, and distance into my shoots. I would then have to take shoots say above-and-to-left of a the person if they were really far away or if they were running I'd have to shoot in front of them and have them run into the bullet. Another great and favorite part of mine for Battlefield was being a medic (and thus having the ability to heal and resurrect your teammates in the field). You could literally not only keep your team at the front lines of the battle by aiding them but your effects would then result in your team pushing the assault forward against the enemy team.\n\nI use to enjoy a good mmorpg but main interest wasn't so much classes as it was pets, I'd love a good pet system. One where you could collect some rare and aesthetically pleasing one and level it so that it made a difference in battle. My class choice was usually wizard (dps) but I always wanted to try healer (support role)."", 'I have played lots of games! MMORPGs are nice, although anything that\'s engrossing is cool.

151,195,Holland Codes anyone? (Like MBTI),"[""Anyone ever hear of a Holland Code? It's an interest inventory (is exactly what it sounds like) and gauges the things important to you, dividing them up into six categories. Your top three letters (each letter is a category) is your type. This psychometric tool is often used for career guidance.\n\nThere six categories are:\nR - Realistic (Doers)\nI - Investigative (Thinkers)\nA - Artistic (Creators)\nS - Social (Helpers)\nE - Enterprising (Persuaders)\nC - Conventional (Organizers)\n\nHere's a quick summary of each category I lifted from a pdf file that had some relevant information:\n\nRealistic (R) types like realistic occupations such as mechanical engineer, landscape gardener, sound technician, cook, exterminator, plumber, locksmith, or safety inspector. They usually have mechanical and athletic abilities, and they like to work outdoors and with tools and machines. They typically like to work with things rather than people. The R type is described as conforming, frank, genuine, hardheaded, honest, humble, materialistic, modest, natural, normal, persistent, practical, shy, and thrifty.\n\nInvestigative (I) types like investigative occupations such as biologist, surgeon, veterinarian, airplane pilot, translator, pharmacist, or actuary. They usually have mathematical and scientific ability and like to work alone. They typically like to explore and understand things or events rather than to persuade others or sell things. The I type is described as analytical, cautious, complex, critical, curious, independent, intellectual, introverted, methodical, modest, pessimistic, precise, rational, and reserved.\n\nArtistic (A) types like artistic occupations such as writer, graphic designer, fashion designer, public relations representative, editor, or architect. They usually have artistic skills, enjoy creating original work, and have good imaginations. The A type is described as creative, disorderly, emotional, expressive, idealistic, imaginative, impractical, impulsive, independent, introspective, intuitive, nonconforming, open, and original.\n\nSocial (S) types like social occupations such as teacher, counselor, nanny, librarian, speech therapist, or home health aide. They usually like to be around other people, are interested in how people get along, and like to help other people with their problems. They typically like to help, teach, and counsel people rather than engage in mechanical or technical activities. The S type is described as convincing, cooperative, friendly, generous, helpful, idealistic, kind, patient, responsible, social, sympathetic, tactful, understanding, and warm.\n\nEnterprising (E) types like enterprising occupations such as salesperson, contractor, entrepreneur, human resources specialist, lawyer, newscaster, or lobbyist. They usually have leadership and speaking abilities, are interested in money and politics, and like to influence people. They typically like to persuade or direct others rather than work on scientific or complicated topics. The E type is described as acquisitive, adventurous, agreeable, ambitious, attention-getting, domineering, energetic, extroverted, impulsive, optimistic, pleasure-seeking, popular, self-confident, and sociable.\n\nConventional (C) types like conventional occupations such as accountant, cashier, fire inspector, data manager, or proofreader. They usually have clerical and math abilities, and they like to work indoors and organize things. They typically like to follow orderly routines and meet clear standards, avoiding work that does not have clear directions. The C type is described as conforming, conscientious, careful, efficient, inhibited, obedient, orderly, persistent, practical, thrifty, and unimaginative\n\nHere's some more information for you on Wikipedia:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland_Codes\n\nYour can find &quot;best suited careers&quot; for your type (top 3 letters) via google.\n\n\nYou can take a free version of the test here:\nhttp://personality-testing.info/tests/RIASEC.php\n\n\nI scored EIS = Enterprising, Investigative, Social\nEnterprising: 39\nInvestigative: 37\nSocial: 33\nRealistic: 30\nConventional: 19\nArtistic: 18\n\n\nHopefully seeing the categories before hand won't bias your test results too much. Take the test (48 questions on the publicly available test) and see what you get and then share it on here so we can vicariously learn something too. I think it should be interesting to see one's Holland Code and compare it to their MBTI type."", 'Apparently I am an IAR.', ""I'm surprised I hadn't heard of this. I tested as SAI. Fairly predictable result for INFP I think."", ""Cool, cool. Thanks for sharing everyone. :)\n\nI find it interesting that Chanisihaya highest score was Investigative. I'm not sure it'd jump to the conclusion that Investigative (Holland Code) is the same thing as Thinking or Introversion (in MBTI) but I do see some similar qualities among their descriptions.\n\nI could see turtles's top score Social being related to the dominant function Feeling but at the same time could see a case made for Extraversion.\n\nGood stuff. I find it interesting both of your second highest score was Artistic.\n\nFYI, there's a similar concept of &quot;opposites&quot; in the Holland Code. It's illustrated by a hexagon, I'll just try and sketch it below (though mine will look like a rectangle but you should still get the idea).\n\nRealistic -------- Investigative\nl l\nl l\nConventional Artistic\nl l\nl l\nEnterprising ----- Social\n\n^^^^^ Basically if there's a line connecting the two types then they have similar interests and the types that are furthest a part of the most different interests. E.g. Realistic types have similar interests with Conventional and Investigative. Investigative types have similar interests with Realistic and Artistic. Artistic types have similar interests with Investigative and Social. Just go around the the rectangle and the two types (on both sides) are the ones with similar interests. The types that are furthest a part have the most different interests. E.g. Realistic and Social; Investigative and Enterprising; Conventional and Artistic. I hope I made sense.\n\nIt might also be worth mentioning the score you got for each category, I'll edit my post to include my. Because in mine my top two scores (Investigative and then Enterprising) are very close to each other.\n\nAnd yea, @turtles Holland Codes aren't as popular as MBTI but there is a whole career thing centered around it. You can google your three letter code and it will give you a list of top jobs and usually the jobs have some index number from the U.S. State Department - so you know they're serious.

I like to find unconventional and beautiful ways of understanding the world - sometimes by thinking with metaphors and analogies - and that seems to be line with the Artistic temperament.\n\nAs a generalization, I feel that some traits associated with the Artistic type - like creativity, intuition, openness, and disorderliness - could perhaps be mapped to the values and characteristics of NPs in MBTI.', 'Yea, I definitely agree it\'d be prevalent if not a trait of intuition; I could also see the creative and imaginal aspects as part of the introverted thinking function. I find your description of wanting to understand the ""unconventional and beautiful"" aspects of the world and conveying this through ""metaphors and analogies"" as something that resonates with me and what I like to do; I think this little dynamic is also in line with Carl Jung\'s description of introverted thinking function in his book Psychological Types - maybe not the essence of the whole function but perhaps more a modality.', ""Just read this now, and I'm a SAC.

152,196,Survey of 24 Character Strengths Test,"['Time for more personality test related stuff... Allusion to my earlier topic in the Psychology subforum on the personality test where you get your Holland Code. If you haven\'t checked it out - do so and share you results.\n\nI know some of you enjoy personality tests and what not and learning about themselves and others so here\'s a good one for you guys. The Holland Code test was in interest inventory trying to gauge and categorize your interests; this test on the other hand tries to order a set of ""character strengths"" according to ""strongest and weakest"". This test is developed out of the Psychological school/subfield of Positive Psychology. P.P. is one of the more recent branches of Psychology (along with Evolutionary Psychology (Psychobiology)), the main idea is that traditional psychology has a focus on or rather model of treating disease. You have some mental illness, something abnormal and/or unhealthy going on and people try to help ameliorate whatever the ""problem"" is. P.P. on the other hand has a focus on the - you guessed it - positive side of things; the idea being one studies people who are healthy and successful and ""flourishing"" (one of their, positive psychologists, favorite word) and applies that to/uses psychology and how it can help us everyday folk.\n\nSo yea, that\'s about that. Here\'s a video by one of the founders (Martin Seligman) talking about and making a case for P.P.\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology\n\n\nWhile writing this post I found some website with a list of the character strengths, I didn\'t have it on me but wanted something more than names of each strength for this post. The list below is of the 24 character strengths organized apparently into 6 categories. Website:\nhttp://www.viacharacter.org/www/Character-Strengths/VIA-Classification\n\n1. Wisdom and Knowledge: Cognitive strengths that entail the acquisition and use of knowledge\n--- Creativity [originality, ingenuity]: Thinking of novel and productive ways to conceptualize and do things; includes artistic achievement but is not limited to it\n--- Curiosity [interest, novelty-seeking, openness to experience]: Taking an interest in ongoing experience for its own sake; finding subjects and topics fascinating; exploring and discovering\n--- Judgment [critical thinking]: Thinking things through and examining them from all sides; not jumping to conclusions; being able to change one\'s mind in light of evidence; weighing all evidence fairly\n--- Love of Learning: Mastering new skills, topics, and bodies of knowledge, whether on one\'s own or formally; obviously related to the strength of curiosity but goes beyond it to describe the tendency to add systematically to what one knows\n--- Perspective [wisdom]: Being able to provide wise counsel to others; having ways of looking at the world that make sense to oneself and to other people\n\n2. Courage: Emotional strengths that involve the exercise of will to accomplish goals in the face of opposition, external or internal\n--- Bravery [valor]: Not shrinking from threat, challenge, difficulty, or pain; speaking up for what is right even if there is opposition; acting on convictions even if unpopular; includes physical bravery but is not limited to it\n--- Perseverance [persistence, industriousness]: Finishing what one starts; persisting in a course of action in spite of obstacles; ?œgetting it out the door?? taking pleasure in completing tasks\n--- Honesty [authenticity, integrity]: Speaking the truth but more broadly presenting oneself in a genuine way and acting in a sincere way; being without pretense; taking responsibility for one\'s feelings and actions\n--- Zest [vitality, enthusiasm, vigor, energy]: Approaching life with excitement and energy; not doing things halfway or halfheartedly; living life as an adventure; feeling alive and activated\n\n3. Humanity: Interpersonal strengths that involve tending and befriending others\n--- Love: Valuing close relations with others, in particular those in which sharing and caring are reciprocated; being close to people\n--- Kindness [generosity, nurturance, care, compassion, altruistic love, ""niceness""]: Doing favors and good deeds for others; helping them; taking care of them\n--- Social Intelligence [emotional intelligence, personal intelligence]: Being aware of the motives and feelings of other people and oneself; knowing what to do to fit into different social situations; knowing what makes other people tick\n\n4. Justice: Civic strengths that underlie healthy community life\n--- Teamwork [citizenship, social responsibility, loyalty]: Working well as a member of a group or team; being loyal to the group; doing one\'s share\n--- Fairness: Treating all people the same according to notions of fairness and justice; not letting personal feelings bias decisions about others; giving everyone a fair chance.\n--- Leadership: Encouraging a group of which one is a member to get things done, and at the same time maintaining good relations within the group; organizing group activities and seeing that they happen.\n\n5. Temperance: Strengths that protect against excess\n--- Forgiveness: Forgiving those who have done wrong; accepting the shortcomings of others; giving people a second chance; not being vengeful\n--- Humility: Letting one\'s accomplishments speak for themselves; not regarding oneself as more special than one is\n--- Prudence: Being careful about one\'s choices; not taking undue risks; not saying or doing things that might later be regretted\n--- Self-Regulation [self-control]: Regulating what one feels and does; being disciplined; controlling one\'s appetites and emotions\n\n6. Transcendence: Strengths that forge connections to the larger universe and provide meaning\n--- Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence [awe,wonder, elevation]: Noticing and appreciating beauty, excellence, and/or skilled performance in various domains of life, from nature to art to mathematics to science to everyday experience\n--- Gratitude: Being aware of and thankful for the good things that happen; taking time to express thanks\n--- Hope [optimism, future-mindedness, future orientation]: Expecting the best in the future and working to achieve it; believing that a good future is something that can be brought about\n--- Humor [playfulness]: Liking to laugh and tease; bringing smiles to other people; seeing the light side; making (not necessarily telling) jokes\n--- Spirituality [faith, purpose]: Having coherent beliefs about the higher purpose and meaning of the universe; knowing where one fits within the larger scheme; having beliefs about the meaning of life that shape conduct and provide comfort\n\n\nYou can take the test (""VIA Survey of Character Strengths"") on this website by signing up for a free account (they track all your scores for convenience sake as well as for academic research purposes I think).\nhttp://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/default.aspx\n\nJust a heads up the online test is like 240 questions long or something so it\'ll take you more than a minute to do the test.\n\nI took the test twice, over a year a part and got similar scores; furthermore I felt that my results were rather accurate in terms of my values, interests, and places where I may excel and fall short - hence I\'ve decided to share the test with you all.\n\nMy most recent results (March 2014):\ntop 5:\n#1 - love of learning\n#2 - judgement, critical thinking, and open-mindedness\n#3 - perspective (wisdom)\n#4 - appreciation of beauty and excellence\n#5 - curiosity and interest in the world\nbottom 5:\n#20 - spirituality, sense of purpose, and faith\n#21 - forgiveness and mercy\n#22 - citizenship, teamwork, and loyalty\n#23 - kindness and generosity\n#24 - capacity to love and be loved\n\nI suppose my results are rather personal or something but ehhh, nothing I didn\'t have an idea about before; besides the results don\'t speak to intensity/level of expression between the character strengths. I also mention my results because I can\'t help but see some relationship between my dominant function/inferior fcn (introverted thinking/extraverted feeling) and my results.\n\nSoo, have fun with it. Hope others decide to take the time to read and share. If you\'re viewing this thread from a mobile phone - I feel bad for you! Lol.', ""Also FYI, I don't expect many people to reply to this or take the test because of how long it is; but, if you do decide to take it and consider sharing - you could always just share your top strengths. I think seeing how other people differ presumably on what they're better at should still be pretty interesting."", 'I was happy to see that you had made a post about the VIA character strengths!\nAnd then I was even more happy to see that there is someone in the world who shares the exact combination of character strengths with me. Thought I was the onlyone in the world :)\ninteresting!', ""I guess it isn't a small world after all! Interesting indeed; I feel like I have to meet 250+ people before I encounter who says they love to learn and do it for its own sake."", 'I agree, the ""love of learning"" strength is rare. Which I guess is the reason to why one so often gets weird looks when one sits with a book in the natural sciences, reading it for fun.\nI wonder to what degree the character strengths correlate with the Myer & Briggs personality types. Would be fun to find out :)\nMaybe, lets say, love of learning, is a strength that is more probable to show up in personality types with ""N"" and mabe the probability increases with the combination of ""N"" and ""T"".\n', ""I'm weary of having to sign up an account on random webpages or I be more inclined to take the test."", 'I like learning, research, reading and writing. They are ways of processing the masses of information that emerge from the world on a daily basis. Whether working or elsewhere I find it therapeutic to be active and busy.']","['Psychology', 'General Topics']",General Topics

I don't really know who &quot;they&quot; are but I'm told they say it.\n\nYou know what I think?? I think &quot;they&quot; are idiots; shriveled forget-me-nots that have read so many black and white books they can't see color anymore. If you look closer with the eye that hides in your subconscious, with the eyes that most dare not open, you would see that the world is infinite. It layers upon itself until it can no longer bear the weight then it starts over. Time is an illusion in the eyes if mankind. You would see that we are who we create ourselves to be. We are not the fallen fruit of an old tree. Fruit that falls rots away and is devoured by other creatures. You would see that you don't need to see at all. Let yourself feel for once. Forget what your eyes tell you. Your eyes lie to you every day. Try reaching out and touching something. Close your eyes and FEEL the pulse of our magnificent planet. &quot;They&quot; say magic doesn't exist? When you feel you will finally know magic is all around us, inside of us. It is in everything from the changing seasons to that thing we call love and especially in our very souls and abilities and when we let go of what &quot;They&quot; say and find our own path, amazing things happen.\n\nHey gents. I go by three different names, Sonia - Crimson -Lanie. I am not particular by which name I am called. I have been searching for my twin soul for quite some time and have discovered that I like and might be compatible with an INFP male.\n\nI am located in Goodyear, Arizona and will NOT long distance date. If anyone is out there..

meet and INFP, YOU have to approach us. That?™s a biggie. We INFP?™s give out difficult auras, making us seem unapproachable, but when someone talks to us and asks us about our lives, we arent shy to tell many great things.\nDo not approach us in numbers, for we are very unfocused. It throws us off when we are approached by more than one person at a time. You and only you need to show a sign of interest.\nI would definately be interested in you, but im looking locally as well. And, even if we were residing in nearby towns, i would have a very difficult time expressing myself entirely in front of you.

I don't really know who &quot;they&quot; are but I'm told they say it.\n\nYou know what I think?? I think &quot;they&quot; are idiots; shriveled forget-me-nots that have read so many black and white books they can't see color anymore. If you look closer with the eye that hides in your subconscious, with the eyes that most dare not open, you would see that the world is infinite. It layers upon itself until it can no longer bear the weight then it starts over. Time is an illusion in the eyes if mankind. You would see that we are who we create ourselves to be. We are not the fallen fruit of an old tree. Fruit that falls rots away and is devoured by other creatures. You would see that you don't need to see at all. Let yourself feel for once. Forget what your eyes tell you. Your eyes lie to you every day. Try reaching out and touching something. Close your eyes and FEEL the pulse of our magnificent planet. &quot;They&quot; say magic doesn't exist? When you feel you will finally know magic is all around us, inside of us. It is in everything from the changing seasons to that thing we call love and especially in our very souls and abilities and when we let go of what &quot;They&quot; say and find our own path, amazing things happen.\n\nHey gents.

157,201,ENTJ and INTP romance,"[""The ideal match for an INTP is an ENTJ (hopefully the reverse is equally true) but I don't believe I'm met an ENTJ so I have no idea why a relationship with one would be good, or what the barriers would be. Has anyone ever dated an INTP?"", ""I'm an INTP who has dated an ENTJ. She and I had many shared interests and the conversation was interesting but she rarely had time to go out and kept trying to make every date a social event. However, we did work together very well when she was in charge and I took care of the details. If you're a woman and into traditional gender roles, I can see how that kind of arrangement might work for you."", ""I was married to ENTJ. Long before I knew about MBTI. This was my longest relationship - at the end still didn't work out. I drove him crazy with my lack of planning. He drove me crazy with always wanting to know what's a plan. I don't have a plan!"", ""I've never really had a relationship with an INTP - I only knew of one and she was quite a broken individual who was far too opinionated and narrow-minded for me to handle.\n\nENTJ's like control and planning - they respect and appreciate those who trust them with this. If you trust an ENTJ with the big stuff and focus on the other 'between the lines' things that are smaller you'll stand out and be what they are looking for. Being submissive is a prerequisite when I look for a girl because I know (and I don't mean to sound arragant) that any woman trying to be assertive, dominant and not taking into account the way my brain adapts to a multitude of situations they are simply ignorant (applies to male social interactions too). When interacting with an ENTJ they are learning everything about you, and are doing it ten times quicker than the pace in which they learnt it. So if someone thinks they immediately know more than the ENTJ he/she will quickly get up to speed and challenge some interesting questions as a part of their learning process. This sometimes gets them into trouble. This also highlights the kind of person that is not a good partner for an ENTJ - as they can't keep up with the ENTJ and neither do they respect him.\n\nA great partner for an ENTJ is one who can see this. Those who cannot typically cause problems for the ENTJ.\n\nMy perspective and from my experience anyway."", 'im a INTP....i was mistyped as an ENTP (my own fault) for far too long.....chased infjs and drove them crazy....\n\nso question is where to find entjs??\n', ""I keep hearing how INTP are ideal for ENTJ. I've been on a date with one and while it was intellectually stimulating, he was way too flighty and he thought I was too intense. I also hear about INFP/ENTJ compatibility; I can only imagine how being with someone leading with Fi would drive me crazy. I've gotten along best with other NJ types."", ""I have a suspicion that INTP - ENTJ matches work better when the ENTJ would be the male and the INTP would be the female (presuming we're talking about heterosexual relationships). No offense intended to those who might be same sex attracted nor egalitarian minded folks.. Am speaking in terms of traditional societal roles."", ""My INTP experience was mostly positive. We had many cultural differences that caused conflict and eventually she returned to her country for family reasons.\n\nMy advice to other ENTJs is you must relax more about the nuisance of daily life. Most things don't need a plan. Make spontaneity the plan more often. If your intimate partner wanted a military leader, then s/he would be in the military. Spontaneity will provide you unforeseeable riches to discover along the way. Go explore!""]","['Rationals', 'ENTJ - Executive', 'Personality']",ENTJ - Executive
158,202,FJ's and INTP's,"[""I wonder if anyone has any insight into how to make an FJ relationship last? As friends, we're fine but as soon as we take it to another level, it just hurts.\n\nThe biggest issue I've found is that FJ's like talking about their feelings and their problems, while I really dislike doing that, to a factor of 10. If they say something hurtful, I can never bring it up at the time and long after they've forgotten about it, I'm still hurt by it but can't seem to put it into words.\n\nI know that communication is meant to be the most important thing for an INTP to work on, but it's bloody hard! Especially when you feel like crying. Or just want to hit them. i don't like admitting to myself that I have emotions, and really don't want to display it to the person who just hurt me. I seem incapable of verbalising it and when I am ready, days (possibly weeks) have passed.\n\nI do love how in touch they are with their emotions, and they are incredibly self-aware, but at times they seem to wallow in self-pity when they need to get off their arses and do something about it. We're not exactly known for our emotionally supportive ways and having to listen to the same problem over and over is annoying. There is a solution - find it, do it and get past the emotional crap. Is it odd that what I like about them is the thing that annoys me the most?\n\nNot sure if anyone else has noticed it, but FJ's always know where they stand and how they feel about things. I find it compelling as hell, but it never works out. Everything I've read said we'll have more luck with an ENTJ, but I've never met one and I'm generally not attracted to thinking types and still kinda hoping I can hypnotise a certain INFJ and make him love me and change a lot of his personality....."", ""ENTJ? Not for me! As for FJ's, it depends a lot if she (being a guy myself) is an S or N. I meet plenty of SFJ's and I don't get along well with them. By the time I start using more 'nerdy', abstract words or if they are more controlling (Type 1 Enneagram) than giving (Type 2 Enneagram), it won't go anywhere. It helps when another understand us INTPs, and SFJs, even if they try, isn't as good as NFJs.\n\nI have never been in a relationship with NFJs, though I knew a few and often become friends quickly with NFPs. All the NFJs I meet in real life ??offline ??were already in relationships. ENFJs tend to seek out those people on the fringe... those people who are clearly different than the norm. And since we INTPs are that, some are attracted to us for that reason. The only exception is if this different person is hostile in any way. They seek to raise everyone's happiness, and therefore really dislike such people. They are also better than others in getting some quiet people to open up and/or give a good attempt to understand them. INFJs are similar, but not as potent in this way as their Extroverted Feeling function is secondary.\n\nAnother curious thing I hear from many ENFJs I encountered online is while they seek out many people to befriend and help out (unlike us introverts), like us introverts they too desire a special select group of people to have more personal and private conversations with. INFJs of course seek quality of quantity anyway.\n\nBOTH NEED TO FEEL THAT THE LOVE THEY GIVE IS APPRECIATED. The worst thing one can do is take advantage of their Type 2-ness. This is something we INTPs need to work the hardest to make this pairing to work. We actually have to use our inferior function, which is the ENFJ's dominate!\n\nEdit for silly speling errors."", ""I don't get along with SFJ's either, and I live with two of them! I've found they are very traditional and if they are controlling, it just leads to fights.\n\nWhy did you say no to ENTJ? We're supposed to better off in a relationship with an ENTJ or a smart ESTJ. I have met one ESTJ but never an ENTJ so have no idea how that would work out.\n\nI think you're right about ENFJ's - went out with one and it lasted a whole 18 months, but there were communication differences. He'd take an FJ stance on something, I'd be the other way and we genuinely couldn't see the other persons viewpoint. We'd be at an angry empasse for ages. I understand INFJ's really well, and we get on so well, but I find that their inferior Se makes them look around at what they have and want more, which includes relationships, which really pisses me off, lol.\n\nI'm kinda like an ENFJ in that I need a select group of people. I gave them all the MBTI test and they were all N types. Can't believe how much of a stereotype I am, ha ha.\n\nHadn't realised that the ENFJ has the same dominant as our auxiliary. I know the ESFJ does, and that doesn't seem to do well for us. My mums' weakness is my forte, and vice versa. Communicating with my mum seems to start more arguments, unless I lie and feign interest in S subjects, or morality-induced F topics.\n\nYou are right about feeling the love is appreciated, and will add returned. With INFJ's, I do feel like I'm constantly being reviewed, and compared with other people (people who are around the INFJ, and people from their past). Can never tell if I've being paranoid or if their inferior is making them wonder if I'm right for them. They are such perfectionists and I feel compelled to not be me, but like a perfect version of myself to keep their attention. I don't want that feeling anymore, so moving away from FJ types (which is hard because I'm always attracted to their minds) and trying a TJ type...... Which is weird and scary as I don't think I've ever met one. To my knowledge, anyway. If a TJ won't work, I'm giving up on dating until there's a foolproof formula to love without pain."", 'I tend to get a tad bit competitive with other NTs.

They have Fe Ni Se Ti while we have Ti Ne Si Fe. The first and last are swapped, the middle two change the e/i bits.\n\nThat was me being an idiot. I meant inferior. After you said that, I looked it up and was amazed it was almost reversed. I live with an ESFJ and they are our exact opposite.

They are very moralistic but don\'t really pressure me to be the same. ESFJ\'s do! I find INFJ\'s are secretly very insecure and kind, but expect perfection from themselves, then beat themselves up because they aren\'t perfect. No idea why, but I find that adorable and sweet.\n\nI find the biggest barrier to friendship/relationship is the S factor - I can\'t talk to one for too long without thinking ""idiot"". Is that normal??\n\nINFJ females tend to find their ideal guy and never stray. Even after they break-up. Makes it hard to get with one!

I get what it must be like to have your inner voice telling you that you're not good enough, but I want to beat up that voice in his head and guide him towards a happier life but that has to come within. I know this, and yet I want to change it anyway!"", ""May want to stay on the hunt for an FJ that is closer to you on the spectrum. I have an INFJ friend who is really analytical, while still surely being an INFJ.... and I'm an INTP who wants to be more in touch with their emotions / is a bit more F than the average INTP while still surely being one... so we kinda meet in the middle and it works out well. I could see if I found some FJ's that were on a similar wavelength a romantic relationship could work.\n\nOther INFJ's I know aren't nearly as T as she is. Perhaps finding a TJ with a bit more 'F' than average might also work out better for you.\n\nAlso from what I understand the ENTJ / ESTJ is like the theoretical / classical example of who INTP's are supposed to get along with... but I'm not sure if it's all that practical.

Whilst I am my only example (it is the only place in my relationship with my sister that we struggle) I can imagine that this is a stressor for any relationship were one person ""doesn\'t care enough"" as many Ts have a very subtle unique way of showing emotion that many Fs may find ""cold"". Although INFJs N can deduce that this isn\'t true, they may look for someone that shows emotion in the same way they do.

160,204,Do you talk to yourself and hold an active conversation?,"[""I'm curious if this is part of my personality trait or I'm just a little crazy. Whenever I believe I'm alone like in the shower, in my bedroom, or while in the car I tend to talk to myself quite actively both asking the questions and responding as if I were giving another vantage point. It's never as an agree or disagree, but as a different view on the topic and have an explanation on hand why that viewpoint is valid even as a conflicting argument to my view. I tend to imagine that it is someone other than myself answering back, an impartial opinion that I may not have thought of initially; however, it is still myself giving the answer.\n\nIn my latest tirade with myself I have come to the conclusion that Time Traveling is not achievable without aid from the period you are traveling to; that it is more plausible to travel in the past than into the future as you can use historical records to calculate your projected landing point as it were.\n\nThe first problem is that your position on Earth is not the same as your position on the fabrics of Space-Time. Our planet is not stationary, it's constantly moving through Space-Time as are other celestial bodies around us; you have to calculate the speed of Earth's rotation, the revolution around the Sun, and spiraling of the Galaxy to the point you are time traveling. Even if to say your time traveling machine is stationary if you were go back 100 years it would not be at the same place you were on Earth rather the empty vacuums of space that Earth has yet to occupy or worse another celestial body that is already there. This is not impossible to accomplish though as we can send satellites into the Earth's orbit and track its spacial positioning for the next 100 years, the future would already have those records and be able to pinpoint the location in Space-Time that you want to go to.\n\nThe second problem is the Matter and Mass that already exists in the area that you would appear, science fiction tends to allude this point as you can appear out of thin air except that is the problem, air or specifically surrounding gases. The gas around still has Mass and that would take priority over what is coming in and it would either obliterate you or fuse with your incoming body, otherwise killing you (think air bubbles in your bloodstream). Maybe you can appear in the emptiness of the vacuum of space; however, space is not actually empty, while it is a vacuum, random elements and molecules still float around not to mention radiation and if String Theory is true that's a whole other boat of problems."", ""I have an ex that I dated for years, and I have imaginary conversations with him in the car a lot. Or in the house. I know what he would say, and we do have bizarre conversations.\n\nTo go back in time, you can't appear out of thin air, you'd have to land on the planet or go through a portal somehow. If u have a spaceship, then you'll be able to track down the planet, which makes things easier. But also harder as Nasa won't let us borrow their shuttles easily. We'd have to find a way to break in and smuggle it out, so a minaturisation ray will be needed too. Then we can work on breaking the time barrier."", ""I do this all the time. Sometimes to prepair my feelings so I don't come off the right. Other times just have witty comebacks prepaird. But most of the time when I talk to myself and/or an imaginary versions of people is becasue I don't know how to express whatever I wish I could tell them at least not without rubbing them the wrong way. I doubt it's Strictly an INTP thing but it could be seeing as most times I end up on the cusp for E/I and have tested resulting as INTP once before."", ""I get typed as an ENTP by extroverts - mainly because I mirror them so if they are loud, I get loud.

161,205,Sigmund Freud on Homosexuality,"['I was reading this introductory-overview book on Freudian Psychoanalysis (""Basic Freud"" by Michael Kahn) and I came across this passage, a quote from one of Freud\'s letters, I liked (as in thought it was heart-warming and what not) and decided to share it. The author didn\'t actually provide a source, just a casual reference about a famous letter from 1935; but, apparently there\'s a separate Wikipedia page just on this topic.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud\'s_views_on_homosexuality\n\nThe first paragraph was excerpted from the book and then the Wiki page had some more of the letter.\n\nA woman (mother) wrote to Freud inquiring if her son could be treated for/""cured"" of his homosexuality. Freud\'s alleged reply:\n""I gather from your letter that your son is a homosexual. I am most impressed by the fact that you do not mention this term yourself in your information about him. May I question you why you avoid it? Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals, several of the greatest men among them. (Plato, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, etc). It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime ??and a cruelty, too. If you do not believe me, read the books of Havelock Ellis.\n\nBy asking me if I can help [your son], you mean, I suppose, if I can abolish homosexuality and make normal heterosexuality take its place. The answer is, in a general way we cannot promise to achieve it. In a certain number of cases we succeed in developing the blighted germs of heterosexual tendencies, which are present in every homosexual; in the majority of cases it is no more possible. It is a question of the quality and the age of the individual. The result of treatment cannot be predicted.\n\nWhat analysis can do for your son runs in a different line. If he is unhappy, neurotic, torn by conflicts, inhibited in his social life, analysis may bring him harmony, peace of mind, full efficiency, whether he remains homosexual or gets changed.""\n\nAlso on a related but random note - to anyone so inclined - if you search ""lewes 1988, freud"" on Amazon you seem to get results for books that are on the topics of homosexuality and psychology and/or therapy.', 'I found that to be an insightful & engaging quote.\nThank you for sharing.', 'That was great!

162,206,Are you homophobic?,"[""If so, on a scale of 1-10, how homophobic are you and why?\n\nI am a complete non-homophobe, as I believe that people should love whoever they love despite their sex, because we are still people.\n\nI hate the idea of marriage only being for reproduction. Isn't marriage supposed to be for love?\n\nHowever, I will not judge you for being a homophobe. As I have said, I don't judge people until I know them."", 'In truth it\'s hard to determine how one would truly feel or act based on a hypothetical experience, or plainly stated ""What If - Then Else"" than when you\'re confronted with the situation in a spur of the moment, unexpected circumstances. I can say that I have no prejudices towards anyone in my head and at that moment believe it; however, in reality I know that isn\'t true as I have displayed fearful behavior in the past towards people who ""appear menacing"" and have side-stepped to avoid any confrontation. That does count as a form of prejudice, though passively, yet still falls in that category whether or not one tries to justify the action.', 'So you\'re a homophobe? You completly avoided answering the question. This isn\'t about ""hypothetical situations,"" she simply asked the above. Why did you answer in such a way?', '', '', ""You should love whoever reciprocates the most compatibility. Otherwise you become someone else's host/resource/crop."", 'You are for sure avoiding the question. Talking about an irrelevant topic (circumventing away from the question) to answer a specifically asked question is the only necessary qualifier for my assertion. If it makes you uncomfortable you should just say; ""I am uncomfortable answering such a question."" This is not a ""hypothetical scenario."" What is stated was (again): ""How do you feel about the gay life style?"" Pretty straightforward.\n\nYour lack of a direct response speaks volumes. Just don\'t answer if it makes you uncomfortable. Are you unaware that avoidance of direct questions gives the impression of (not pushing the idea that you are or are not for the gay lifestyle) intolerance or that you are against what was asked of you? Just a thought. Perhaps it is common for your personality type to answer questions in this way? Does not excuse your lack of directness.', 'on the scale 0 (zero).\nI have a few very good gay friends, co-workers, associates and more.\nNo problem, never has been.', ""Probably about a 1, and this is while being bi myself. I just find myself talking and thinking sometimes about things in terms of just men and women together - and while it's cultural, unconscious, and mostly harmless - it still seems to register in my view."", ""I think it'd probably be silly if I were -__-, lol.\nI'd miss out on knowing some pretty f*ing awesome peeps xD"", 'Nope, I love other woman. 0 out of 0!!!!!!!!!!!', 'Nope.\n\nI think mostly homophobic are insecure with themselves.', ""I'm here to look for a sexy male ISFJ to flirt with, so I'm like the least homophobic in existence. -10/10?"", ""Can't stop how your brain is wired, people should be with the ones they love, whether it be a guy or girl, or many of both. I've heard of a lot of different arrangements.\nI'd say on an overall I'm a 2/10. Only because my INFP powers let me know early who likes who, so far been right every time.\n\nAs far as actions, I had a guy ask me out once at a pool hall/bar. Told him,&quot;Sorry dude I appreciate you think I'm sexy, but I don't swing that way&quot;. I pointed him to another gentleman at the bar. Don't know where it went from there though."", 'First off, and admittedly off-topic, I must say, asking an INTP to explain their thought process if you don\'t understand it the first time is an exercise in futility, as lengthy conversations with my best friend have often shown me. If I do understand I\'ll reword it in a much more concise manner, like so:\n\nI believe what TimidTraveller was trying to say is:\n\n""I don\'t know whether or not I am homophobic, because I find it difficult to imagine myself in a situation where any homophobia I have would present itself. If I were in such a situation, it\'s likely that my actions would belie any statements I make here regarding said homophobia.""\n\nPlease, let me know if I missed the mark on that one, it helps when I have clear identification of my mistakes.\n\nOn Topic:\n\nI\'m not homophobic because I enjoy spending time with my gay friends on occasion, and I don\'t hate gay people. I am homophobic because I can\'t avoid seeing gay people as other, and I find the though of my own participation in a homosexual act, or watching others participate in them, disgusting, and seek to avoid both of these things.\n\nSo, my homophobia would rate as X/10, where X is whatever arbitrary number you want to fill in, based on the information I just gave you.', ""Honestly, it's not a popular opinion these days but at least a 5/10.\nDon't care whatever you do, it's your thing. If you want to make love to a Trans, I don't give a shit.\nJust leave me alone an don't talk about it all the time. Activist are boring, and often talk the same stuff over and over like a broken vinyle. I'm not going to make a fuss about the fact that I like Asian and European girls... Just leave me alone.\nCivic Union - why not ? Wedding - no. Adoption if it's the last sane resort.\nI'm sure the gay movements are being helped by Governments so that people consume more shit, make the total income higher and/or change our views toward the concept of family.\nThere is surely an economical interest in all that. + When the people think about that, they can focus on unpopular laws. It's just a trick. After all, no one really cares about it unless it offends religions, or anyone lives."", ""I'm not homophobic at all.\n\nI find it very hard to understand why anyone is, once they are of an age to consider things for themselves. I just don't follow the logic.\n\nAnd if you harm none, do as you will :)"", ""I do not consider my self homophobic.\nI as a man I am not attracted to other men. But I value the friendships I have with other men. Those men can be straight or same sex oriented. Besides, my same sex oriented friends are much better at providing personal advise than my straight friends. I should point out that I use the term same sex oriented because I have some friends who are women and they like both men and women. I have friends who are men and they like men and women.\nWhat does make me uncomfortable is dealing with straight people who are homophobic. I don't understand why some people take such angry pleasure from degrading another person because they prefer the same sex for intimate relationships.\nBut I seem to have gone off on another

163,207,INTP careers,"[""I'm curious what everyone has chosen for a career, and what jobs they've done in the past. We're all intelligent and that P does make us bloody indecisive at times, so has anyone managed to find a career that suits them and stick at it? I find that I can't do the same job for too long, or I get bored and do something different. Is anyone else like that?\n\nI worked as a receptionist for a dept store, then in a call centre for an insurance company before I was promoted to a project coordinator (the first time). I then moved to the motor industry and worked as a cost clerk for Ford and then admin for Renault before becoming an internet moderator. And now, I'm a project coordinator again.\n\nHaven't figured out my career yet. This time last year, I was going to be an accountant, and now I'm leaning towards project management. Does anyone else find it hard to stick to one thing?"", ""I was trying to decide whether or not to answer, as I would be the worst example for the cause. I have low self-esteem, zero self-confidence, a great deal of self-loathing. I wanted to be a writer, but that fell through. I thought about a science career, but my inability to speak in front of others prevented completing those courses. I tried the medical path, but that's just as bad freezing up when speaking person to person with strangers. I'm unable to get a job unless it's with family where I don't need to interview for the position where I am always a complete wreck avoiding eye contact, constant stammering, and long periods of quiet moments. I feel more than half of my job interviews probably think I'm a complete moron. This didn't help you at all did it?"", ""Definitely feels difficult to settle on one thing. I tend to be a jack of all trades master of none. Right now I'm doing web design. It's not my passion, but it's highest paying skill I have.\n\nEventually I'd like to get into something less draining that I'm really naturally good at... that my body just naturally takes to. I haven't really found something where I just love the process though."", ""This is the decision I am currently making! I now have a law degree but don't want to be a lawyer so I really don't want to sink any more money into something unless I'm really quite sure. But I'm INTP - I'm never quite sure! I have decided to go for what I feel would be fulfilling over money coupled with a job which is not constantly social. I have a huge interest in human behaviour so I think social research or academia (preferably on the research side). If I hadn't discovered my research interests along the way, I would probably go for editing/book publishing."", 'It seems as an INTP many kinda have to run ""through the maze"" and figure out what they want kinda through process of elimination :/\n\nOoo research, that sounds interesting! What would a day to day job of that be like?\n\nMy ears have started to prick up in regards to research... at least on a general level. I\'ve started to realize how much I love learning about something and then refining it / spitting it back out into some sort of article. I\'ve been wanting to start a blog at some point and see where that goes. Maybe I could make a book out of it? Or get into some other form of research. I kinda like ""being on the hunt"" for information.', ""I'm a Computer Programmer...\n\nI started programming computer's when I was 8 years old, and it was like I found my true love.\n\nSo much so that I built 3 text based video games for my 8th grade science fair project and was the first student in the history of my school system to submit a computer program as an entry, won a blue ribbon. The games were pretty simple to, like &quot;Guess a number between 1 and 10&quot;, &quot;Paper rock scissors&quot;, and &quot;Tic Tac Toe&quot;... Months later I made a game like asteroids and was my first jump to graphics.\n\nSo that was 8th grade, I was 13 and it was 1997..\n\nI pretty much knew at 8, that I was going to be a programmer when I grew up. Simply because I was fortunate enough to find my passion at a young age and I had the parents to provide me with what I needed to do so.\n\nI didn't just program though, I was a full stack kid. I had a network in my house before most people had internet. I had a CD-ROM in my computer before people knew what a CD was. Because my Step Dad was in IT and had access to the latest tech and brought it home or bought it.\n\nI broke the stuff constantly, so I taught my self to fix it. So by the time I was 15 I could build a computer, repair broken circuit boards (jump circuiting), build basic electronic components like an AM Radio. Write code in DBASE III, GW-Basica, Quick Basic, Where I jumped to Visual Basic 6 and then to the .Net Framework. I could setup networks, diagnose hardware problems, and many more things.\n\nAs a result of this, I am a huge reverse engineer too. I often buy things just so I can take them apart and see how they work.\n\nWhen I graduated high school though, I could not find a job without a degree as I had the skills, but that kind of work around wear I live is sparse.. So I went to college online, never opened half of my text books, graduated, and got an internship.\n\nNow I've been doing it for a living for 6 years and I get recruiters poaching me weekly to go work someplace else."", 'At 46 I have decided that I am sick to death of living by other peoples rules in order to get a salary which sustains one just long enough to ensure the continuance of the stupid process. I am going to start a business. I have absolutely no clue what business as as soon as I have wrapped my head around one idea, another presents itself. In the meantime I get up every morning and live according to the wants of a capitalist who has no creativity or vision (what can one expect from insurance right!).\nResearch - if I had known known that I was normal when younger and not forced into trying to be a sensitive, outgoinging people person who needed to fit into this world, I would have liked to do something in research! Or science (quantum physics) but I am useless at math :-(.', 'I don\'t know if this will qualify in relation to careers but.. my personal plans are to develop as sustainable a system as possible on raw land. To build my own house by means of natural building techniques (probably largely cob and recycled materials), to develop as expansive as possible a food forest and generally try to initiate a self-propagating system of natural abundance to rewild the landscape in which I live, if I find other people to do this with and our combined resources allow it, to produce our own electricity on site with photovoltaic technologies as well as possibly building a wind turbine - maybe even experimenting with piezoelectricity.\n\nI personally find participation and any means of supporting the current dominant trends of human socioeconomic organization on the planet to be unacceptable. Our species is degenerating rapidly, as I would think anyone of a recent generation would be aware, with diseases and infertility ever rising throughout modern ""civilization"". This isn\'t to say nothing we have done is of use and that we should try to revert totally to our past form but rather that the potentially beneficial technologies we have discovered are not being implemented in ways that benefit us and all the rest of the life on the planet. in fact, these dominant trends of privatized centralized production - focused on monetary profit (in the form of fiat currency produced by private central banks) inside a market economy which assumes separation, self-initiation, and scarcity - to feed decentralized consumerism are in the process of removing almost all of the life on the planet (probably with the exception of organisms such as tardigrade, some bacteria, fungi, and possibly some plants)...\n\nIn order to oppose such wholly degenerative processes, I think it is vital that our species use whatever means we have to move towards decentralized opensource producerism based on ecology (considerations such as... the conditions of the environment, the needs of living things, the methods we have of meeting those needs, and how those methods affect the conditions of the environment). The practices of modern Permaculture seem to inclusively approach this, in combination with renewable energy technologies that can be implemented laterally as opposed to vertically...\n\nThese are reasons which I think that the focus on a career is not at all enough in life...\n\nif anyone who reads this is interested in such things, maybe you will find this video interesting which discusses the Third Industrial Revolution and the Internet of Things, as it is being called by Jeremy Rifkin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xOK2aJ-0Js\n\nthis addresses what I would consider to be one aspect of what is required, moving forward.. The other half is highly tied into ecology and again I think it is addressed quite well by the practices of permaculture.', ""Recently completed my Bachelor's in Forensic Psychology, following that I worked as a research intern. Currently applying for more research work in the forensic psychology field and I'm going back to university to do my Masters next year. The end goal is to complete my PhD and work in academia full-time, where I can be left alone in my office with all my books and data to analyse."", ""I am currently in the process of lifting my own business off of the ground. It's a bit on the heavy side. It is a hybrid business in which I get to design and sell merchandise (alone at my computer), edit photos (alone at my computer), and watch and compile data about my business and it's finances (alone at my computer). It deeply satisfies my feeling of importance toward individuality, my autonomy, and my creativity. I will no longer be constrained by somebody else's standards, schedule, and work ethic. Cheers. Whatever any of you do, just make sure you rep the INTP master race to it's fullest extent."", ""INTP's love being alone at computers."", ""I'm currently working in customer service in a garden center due to lack of other options, but I find that drama from fellow employees is annoying and endless. I'm going for a degree in social services at the moment (switched last minute from business), but I'm considering changing it to psychology because I don't think I'd handle constant stressful emotional interaction well. Other careers I've thought about include park ranger (thought it would be a quiet job in nature, however, discovered it would have more to do with fishing licenses and parking cars, bleh), entrepreneur, writer, photographer, journalist, researcher, and biologist. Ideally, I'd still love to have more to do with writing and photography than anything else, but I also want to make enough money to afford a small place of my own (preferably with a cat), so I guess I

'So all it took was one spammer to kill this thread? But I digress...\n\nI am a mechanical engineer. I have studied machinery all my life and have invested too much person time into figuring hot how something is made. I have worked in several different functions in a different companies. They were all technically related functions.', 'All careers are the devil', 'Im an Industrial Machine Prostitute :-) Pay me enough money and I can and will work on any part of any industrial machine. This includes mechanical, electrical, controls, and programming. I have so far found it best to do it as a contractor. That gives me variety and new challenges all the time. Makes for good income, but a REALLY sucky personal life as Im gone most of the time.\n\nMy passion is alternative housing and energy systems. So far built a solar system to run my fridge (still fleshing out the complete system with automation), and built my office from a 20 foot shipping container. Both are basically ""experimental"" to find out what works and what doesnt for a fully off-grid home built with my own hands.', ""I am fairly satisfied working in the sewer. My company does flow monitoring, line cleaning, smoke testing, geolocating, inspecting... pretty much anything that has to do with testing or maintaining underground water/sewer utilities. I have to be competent in many skills from general construction and carpentry to electronics programming and repair to pipe fitting, and more recently, wireless communication diagnostics as water and sewer monitoring move into the 'smart cities' arena. While I'm typically able to 'tunnel vision' on my specific task, that task changes from one job to the next so I don't get bored or burnt out over time. I dunno if its a INTP thing, but my unemotional nature makes it lot easier for me to do this work and stay calm in tight, dark spaces with lots of spiders and human waste, which is FAR preferable to jobs where I would have to deal with people instead.\n\nMy pre-college career aptitude test identified me as 99% compatible with being a plumber. I called BS, but 20 years later that's pretty close to what I do."", ""I am a lawyer. That should make me more and infj-Counselor. And I have been identified as infj on a couple of occasions. However, I think that's certain aspects of my personality are close to the zero point. Or perhaps certain aspects of my personality swings over to the complimentary side. Hence my current INTP. And though I find myself living the counselor role in my work, I don't dream about engaging in the architect role. Sometimes how you can live it, by for example creating recipes for designing living spaces for my own personal use."", ""I do math tutoring/statistics consulting. I'm self employed, which is nice except for how harsh my boss can be at times (No PTO, working weekends, etc). I find that it is the perfect job for me since I did the regular 9-5 thing for a while with a research institute and decided that I hate being part of a hierarchy. This feeds my intrinsic desire to be a know-it-all, and I only have to teach one student at a time. (I've been offered jobs teaching at high schools, but decided I really don't need a full classroom.) Also allows flexibility, and I do half of my work from home.""]","['Rationals', 'INTP - Architect', 'Personality']",INTP - Architect

I have fantasies with deep, elaborate and unnecessary back stories that explain who the characters are and what they're pursuing. It makes them more than just a random face it fleshes out the character's history, personality, and intentions throughout the story. Most of it is created on the fly, I don't think of it beforehand and let the story lead itself in whatever direction comes up. I do however revisit stories starting back from the beginning reworking some of the details, but keep it true to its original telling as much as possible with some tweaks. A few of the stories are quickies, but most are for extended periods lasting anywhere between an average of 20 mins to upwards of an hour before the point of total climax."", ""I feel that. as much as I as might enjoy a good porno....well most porn isn't that good actually...I love hanging out in imagination land after hours..."", ""From what I recall of stats, at LEAST 80% of the human population self-gratifies (or has at one time or another).

If I fail to do this I have a bad tendency to waste the day away in a spree of curiosity or, in worst cases laziness. Furthermore, it is very important that I do not get side tracked ones I am productive by things like cooking food and such, that can make it hard to slip back in to that productive flow that I was in earlier.', 'N=Energy output/Energy input X100%', ""That is similar to how I sometimes deal with things surprisingly; however I'm a lot better at dealing with situations where variables change and I adapt and replan quickly to prevent that 'overwhelmed' feeling that sometimes forces us to get defensive and avoid the possibility of being in a situation of uncertainty. I call this taking a single step back in order to move 10 paces forward because lets be honest; we as ENTJ's don't take one step back to take three forward - as even that is inefficient.\n\nThe key to efficiency though is quite simple. Control. If I know I'm in control; what could possibly go wrong? I know I'm the most qualified and I know how to use the assets available even if they are more skillfully qualified than myself I know I can use them to the advantage of myself and the group - ENTJ's are leaders and when I woke up and realised there is no changing these traits I have the easier my life became and the amout of people who actually conform can be surprising as most people aren't 'take charge' people.\n\nENTJ's take charge, take control, provide security and bare all responsibilty like it's nothing.

But more specifically, I need to know what makes enfps sexually tick.\nIn terms of questions, what makes enfps sexually aroused and crazy? What are key words, phrases, things, or flirtatious actions that will turn enfps on and make them wild in an instance. I need this to be like an atom bomb going off from the get go. Having that in mind, stories or strategies will also not hurt to know either.\n\nHere is the plan: To find a sexual/social ENFP and make it as intense as possible, as fast as possible, and as crazy as possible, while keeping myself alive somehow (preferable)\n\nHere is what I have: All snipers on lookout.\n\nHere is what I know: I've probably lost my mind already, and if not then probably will do by the end of it."", 'The question, then, is how long will you be able to keep it up?

Or are you really serious that this is what you want?', 'its fun, its adventurous, and its an experience... so im thinking why not? Duration is probably as long as I last to be honest.', 'Well, just a warning, us ENFPs are very serious about relationships. If you do get one to fall for you as hard as you seem to want, be prepared for a very messy breakup. The ENFP will be devastated.', 'To get her to notice you: Be your normal, mysterious self. No pickup lines needed. Say ""Hello"". Tell her your name. Wait. Let your INTJ stare pierce her for a second. She\'ll get it. The ENFPs I know are interested in weirdos, too. So if she\'s an ENFP she probably won\'t run away, even if it\'s awkward for a second. Then engage her and unwrap her mind. Show her you know she\'s smart as fuck, even though she comes across as bubbly. An INTJ I know pulled a really slick move on me...he massaged my back while I hugged him goodbye at the end of our first date. I wanted more.\n\nOnce you\'re dating: Take the lead, make the plans, surprise her with unexpected things. It\'s important to remember to engage your body, too. ENFPs are physical beings, even though they\'re so mental. Be sensual. Touch her. Tell her what you appreciate about her, physically and mentally. INTJs have the rare ability to FULLY appreciate an ENFP, and when we find out that the special inner world we\'ve been cultivating for years is understood, THAT is magic.', ""Oh, and in terms of sex...that's really individual. But, I'd suggest being dominant and somewhat aggressive. Also teasing, but don't make her feel like she has to make the first move. That can make her unsure of your feelings for her.

Innuendos and teasing are really great, as long as you're planning to follow through!

168,212,Can introverts be Narcissistic?,"['I been doing research for a fictional character reference on someone who is a Narcissistic Mother and how they raise their children; I did not anticipate the amount of negative information I got from reading topic after topic on the subject matter. I usually see ""evil"" as a point of perception not a general rule from one individual to the next, but this one takes the vicious cycle to a path I never would have expected. While I\'m going to have to do a major re-write on this character\'s behavior, it did get me thinking about the characteristics of a narcissist and which personalities are more likely to become one.\n\nNot to assume, the character profile seems to fit more in line with extrovert personalities than introverts; however, I can\'t say it doesn\'t happen when raised by someone who is a narcissist. The behavior is almost inherent like with the lack of nurture and psychological breakdown that coincides with it. This is not about people who were raised by a narcissist then become one themselves (thus repeating the vicious cycle), but based on those who become one on their own. Is it possible for an introvert personality type, without an authoritative figure to influence them, to become a narcissist?', 'From personal experience I will say that my father has been diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder and I would very much coin him as in introvert. He is, however, able to summon that ""charisma"" that extroverts commonly have when needs be. I would also add that my dad\'s father also displays a lot of narcissistic behaviors...\n\nTo give you my thoughts on your specific question though, I think that it is equally possible for both extroverts and introverts to become Narcissistic. Narcissism is defined as, ""having an excessive interest in oneself and one\'s physical appearance"". One\'s ""self love"" is not determined on how much someone talks, how one recharges, etc. I do believe it may be more simple to spot an extroverted Narcissist, though.', ""Egotism is a cultural thing. These attitudes are learned. Very common in America as it's all about who has the one up on the next. Also comes from privilege and self entitlement or never having to work for anything. I think introverts would actually be less so if so many weren't so dogmatic thinking every interaction deserves false enthusiasm.\n\nIntroverts just don't pretend that every person they encounter is a god and so interesting. Introverts in truth are honest extroverts who enjoy certain company not company just for the sake of saying oh look at me I'm so great. Which I will never understand. I can be a silly life of the bunch with the right group of people."", 'Depends on I???, at least I chatted with an INTJ for years and he was narcissistic as fuck.', 'Part of the empirical process is observation and whilst the evidence suggests that narcissistic traits or Narcissistic Personality Disorder may be linked to extroversion, it is likey that extroverts display this traits more noticeably. It is, therefore, plausible, that the narcissistic ""profile"" could have been built on extroverted narcissists.\n\nMy best comparison is probably to that of depression. Historically, women display symptoms of depression more than men and also more likely to seek help and so the ""profile"" of depression was built on more feminine displays of it. However, more recently, research has discovered that men may ""display"" depression in different ways to women.\n\n']","['General Myers Briggs', 'Personality']",Personality

170,214,Assimilating your inferior functions,"['For all you psychological type enthusiasts, here\'s a quote from the guy (C.G. Jung) who put together this theory.\n\n""Continual conscious realization of unconscious fantasies [i.e. using \'active imagination\' to explore your inner reality], together with active participation in the fantastic events, has, as I have witnessed in a very large number of cases, the effect firstly of extending the conscious horizon by the inclusion of numerous unconscious contents; secondly of gradually diminishing the dominant influence of the unconscious; and thirdly of bringing about a change of personality.\n\nThis change of personality is naturally not an alteration of the original hereditary disposition, but rather a transformation of the general attitude. Those sharp cleavages and antagonisms between conscious and unconscious, such as we see so clearly in the endless conflicts of neurotic natures, nearly always rest on a noticeable one-sidedness of the conscious attitude, which gives absolute precedence to one or two functions, while the others are unjustly thrust into the background. Conscious realization and experience of fantasies assimilates the unconscious inferior functions to the conscious mind - a process which is naturally not without far-reaching effects on the conscious attitude.""\n\n- paragraphs 358-359, \'The relations between the ego and the unconscious\', in [the book] ""Two Essays on Analytical Psychology"", Carl G.

Topics']",General Topics
171,215,Dominant Extraverted Thinking and its oppositions,"['I enjoyed and was impressed enough with the sections on the inferior functions in this book I\'m reading on the psychological types to share them. The book is ""Jung\'s Compass of Psychological Types"" by James Graham Johnston. I recommend it for several reasons, some being his competent, wholesome, and effective treatment of the subject. The author relates famous historical figures to a particular function to help the reader better conceptually understand the material; he doesn\'t argue that the people in his examples had the said dominant function per se but rather the qualities they exhibited and that are discussed can be related/representative of the dominant function in question. A metaphor of a theatrical stage is used to help the reader grasp the dynamics of the functions and postulated constituents of the psyche.\n\nFeel free to express what stood out to you and if you can relate in the comments replying to this thread.\n\nFYI. ""CW 6"" = Collected Works of C.G. Jung, Psychological Types (book)\n\n\n""[dominant] Extraverted Thinking vs. [inferior] Introverted Feeling\n\'I am fully aware that our age and its most eminent representatives know and acknowledge only the extraverted type of thinking.\' - Carl Jung\n\nA person disposed to extraverted thinking, with introverted feeling as the shadow type [inferior function], may only awkwardly express deep feelings and will likely avoid the the sentimental and poetic aspects of life. He will be cautious about letting the unpredictable, fledgling feeling side of his nature out, for it is beyond his control and not nearly as finely honed as his thinking. He will tend to dislike showing emotion himself and can turn his back on the tearful sentiments of others.\n\nThe \'knock down\' battle in his psyche is between Charles Darwin, representing extraverted thinking, and Anne Frank, representing introverted feeling. Anne has the advantage of being apart from the main stage [consciousness]; she can watch the action there, but the lead actor [ego] cannot see her. She performs her role as one who whispers from behind the curtain as the lead actor plays his given role, much more attentive to the actors who share the conscious stage with him. Her disadvantage is that she is underdeveloped and largely inaccessible to ego consciousness.\n\nTo the degree that the shadow is successful in getting through to the lead, she creates a tension that must be resolved. The lead is drawn to reflective soliloquy. He hears a distant voice calling him to another life, but he can\'t quite make it out. Still the voice of Anne Frank as shadow won\'t go away and she holds him in check, keeping him from taking his ruling formulas and constructed order to a one-sided extreme.\n\nUsing the comparative categories built in previous chapters, we can better imagine the shadow\'s subtle but healthy opposition to the lead actor, holding him back from becoming too engrossed in his role, too needy of audience approval, and too much interested in his own acclaim.\n\n\nTable 7-1 Te Opposed by Fi\nOrientations of\nTe: Extensive Order ; Fi: Intensive Ideals\nComments on Orientation: The lead attends to many particular facts and the logical order that might be found among them; the shadow type encourages him to look intently on ideal images.\n\nAttitudes of\nTe: Perceive Order ; Fi: Apprehend Ideals\nComments on Attitude: the lead is determined to make logical sense of facts, traditions, and things that he fins on the conscious stage; the shadow type wants him to grasp images of ideals delivered by the archetypal audience.\n\nFunctional Roles of\nTe: Constructive Thinking ; Fi: Idealistic Feeling\nComments on Functional Role: The lead plays his role constructing logical order amidst the seeming chaos of things as they are, tightening his control with his ruling formulas of the way things should be; the shadow type encourages him to feel his way, to stay true to his ideals.\n\nSubstances of\nTe: Outer Thoughts ; Fi: Inner Valuations\nComments on Substance: The lead thinks exclusively about what he finds on stage and in the audience of the world; the shadow type wants him to turn to feeling-toned valuations of images delivered from the other side.\n\nScopes of\nTe: Particular Order ; Fi: Holistic Ideals\nComments on Scope: The lead takes life one particular step at a time; he assembles order from many particular facts using his acumen for logic to make sense of those particulars; the shadow type wants him to see the very big picture - to know that beauty and truth as holistic ideals are an important complement to narrowly focused role he is living.\n\n\nIf Darwin, as the lead, refuses to listen to her soft voice calling him to remember the beautiful ideals that are also part of life, if Anne Frank is shut away and forced to live a reclusive life, then the lead gained full and unrestrained power to dominate the stage with his ruling formulas of right and wrong, good and bad. The stage becomes a desolate place and the meek little suppressed kitten-like shadow type becomes a lioness.\n\nExtreme Extraverted Thinking\nJung noticed that the underlying cultural bias of the modern age is toward extraverted thinking. The outer object has been elevated to supreme importance in Western culture, thus likely contributing to the many addictions that plague a culture isolated from its own soul.\n\nIn Western culture, for example, the \'Big Bang\' theory is the commonly accepted conclusion to the great cosmic mystery, \'How did the universe begin?\' It accounts for one observation - the universe appears to be expanding at a rapid rate - but it fails to account for order and pattern, for the rise of galaxies, for the advent of life, or for the existence of consciousness. It is a simple, clean, no-nonsense answer, now widely accepted, that addresses one fact and then seeks to apply it across a broad array of other facts, where it is forced to fit as the prevailing theory.\n\nOur representative for this type, Darwin, spent twenty years assessing a multitude of facts to derive his simple theory of natural selection. The theory fits his facts, but as the cofounder [Alfred Russel Wallace] of that theory of evolution noted, it does not explain the arrival of the human species. Darwin\'s ruling formula, like the Big Bang theory, is phenomena that do not fit with the theory,: the ascent of consciousness, the complexity of cell intelligence, or the propagation of life itself. The opposition from the \'creationist\' camp is often just as dogmatic and reductive in the application of narrowly construed assertions.\n\nWhen extraverted feeling is relied on exclusively, it loses its potency; it denies the relevance of intangible reality, this missing the whole picture. It gets lost in the detail of empirical observation, creating simplified \'ruling formulas\' that cannot account for the full complexity of a question. Rather than ordering and sorting a wide array of facts, particular facts short circuit the thinking process. Thinking seems to spin its wheels, stuck in the mud of its own shortsighted premises.\n\nThe conflict between Freud and Jung had much to do with Freud\'s ruling premises about sexuality; Freud might offer a biographical example of extraverted thinking taken too far. Jung was born to the opposite side of the compass [introversion]; he was compeled to see life more holistically.\n\nNormally accomplished at organizing, forecasting, and synthesizing, the extraverted thinking type taken to a one-sided extreme confines itself exclusively to a narrow range of facts and data. Engrossed in the details of a narrow range of experience, it gets overwhelmed by its exclusive focus on empirical facts.\n\n\'When extraverted thinking is subordinated to the objective data as a result of over-determination by the object, it engrosses itself entirely in the individual experience and accumulates a mass of undigested empirical material. The oppressive weight of individual experiences having little or no connection with one another produces a dissociation of thought which usually requires psychological compensation. This must consist in some simple, general idea that gives coherence to the disordered whole, or at least affords the possibility of such. Ideas like \'matter\' or \'energy\' serve this purpose (CW 6, paragraph 583)\'\n\nThe \'simple, general idea,\' the framework for containing many facts, becomes a \'ruling formula\' that must be applied everywhere. Everything that corresponds to it is correct; everything that does not is wrong. The rich and varied aspects of the outer object are lost to the simplistic point of view that attracts facts to support a narrowly conceived premise.\n\nHighly one-sided extraverted thinking relies simplistically and tyrannically on the power of its dogmatic formula. The other conceived by extraverted thinking attains a dominating power that ignores the nuanced qualities of life. The ruling formula, whatever it may be, is never sufficient to fully embody the rich and subtle qualities of life to which the complementary shadow is more attuned.\n\nThe more the shadow is repressed, the more partial and reductive the conclusions become. With that suppression, the conclusions are adorned in the guise of infallibility and become an intellectual superstition. The repressed shadow rises up with powerful allies from the unconscious. The inferior type attacks everything that extraverted thinking has sought to affirm and does not shrink from secrecy or deception to accomplish its ends.\n\n\'There are guardians of public morals who suddenly find themselves in compromising situations, or rescue workers who are themselves in dire need of rescue . . . In science there are not a few painful examples of highly respected investigators who are so convinced of the truth and general validity of their formula that they have not scrupled to falsify evidence in its favour. Their sanction is: the end justifies the means. Only an inferior feeling function, operating unconsciously and in secret, could seduce otherwise reputable men into such aberrations (CW 6, paragraph 588)\'\n\nThe shadow type\'s intervention on the conscious stage produces touchy and temperamental suspicions. Traitors seem to lurk behind every certain. Disagreements quickly devolve into contests of personal retribution. Battle lines are strictly drawn: \'Those who are not for us must therefore be against us.\' Acrimony, resentment, and aggression may reign for the repressed shadow now screens events and people through a veil of petty mistrust. There is a perpetual tendency to make negative assumptions about other people to invalidate their positions. Those people or those ideas that do not align with the one-sided ruling formula of extraverted thinking are condemned as alien. The individual becomes \'petty, mistrustful, crotchety, and conservative.\'\n\n\'His unconscious sensitivity makes him sharp in tone, acrimonious, aggressive. Insinuations multiply. His feelings have a sultry and resentful character - always a mark of the inferior function (CW 6, paragraph 589).\'\n\nThe shadow type, now as an ugly imp, is projected by the lead onto others. The individual withdraws personal sympathy, denigrates critics, and demolishes opposition by any means available, no matter how perverse. The more the ego relies exclusively on extraverted thinking, the more fanatical the individual becomes. He must fend off haunting \'paroxysms of doubt\' with tyrannical certainty."" - pages 218-224',

""CW 6"" = Collected Works of C.G. Jung, Psychological Types (book)\n\n\n""[dominant] Extraverted Feeling vs. [inferior] Introverted Thinking\nA person oriented to extraverted feeling, with introverted thinking as the shadow type [inferior function], will tend to avoid philosophical questions and deep thinking. They very meaning of of life may ultimately be found there, but extraverted feeling will prefer to to find that meaning ready made in the world of the social order and societal values. She prefers time with others where she gains freedom from the thoughts that periodically alight, often in a critical way, as observations about her own life or others. Being alone with her thoughts can too often bring on a melancholic mood. An orientation to others, to the social world of people, norms, values, and expectations, is her safe refuge from them.\n\nHer primary psychic opposition is between Good Queen Bess [Queen Elizabeth I], representing extraverted feeling, and Immanuel Kant, representing introverted thinking. The Queen on the main stage seeks harmony among her troupe; she is attentive to the norms and standards she finds among them, but her shadow opposite behind stage whispers that she should discard all of that and think for herself. Our table of comparative categories can help to more fully grasp how Kant could be the Queen\'s determined antagonist.\n\n\nTable 7-2 Fe Opposed by Ti\nOrientations of\nFe: Extensive Norms ; Ti: Intensive Insights\nComments on Orientation: The lead attends to particular social protocols and norms - she is loathe to transgress tradition; the shadow type encourages her to forget all that and to look intently on new ideas.\n\nAttitudes of\nFe: Perceive Norms ; Ti: Apprehend Insights\nComments on Attitude: The lead is determined to sustain social harmony on the conscious stage; the shadow type whispers that she could also be sovereign over new insight.\n\nFunctional Roles of\nFe: Social Feeling ; Ti: Conceptual Thinking\nComments on Functional Role: The lead plays her role by empathizing with others, feeling her way from one event or gathering to another; the shadow type encourages her think philosophically about life, to also find harmony in truth.\n\nSubstances of\nFe: Other Valuations ; Ti: Inner Thoughts\nComments on Substance: The lead works with her feeling-values to discern what she likes or dislikes in particular about people or events; the shadow type wants her to step back from her feeling-values and think more intensively with holistic thoughts about what is pure and true, rather than dawdle about, evaluating what she likes or doesn\'t like about the world around her.\n\nScopes of\nFe: Particular Norms ; Ti: Holistic Insights\nComments on Scope: The lead is very oriented to detail, she is quite interested in all of them, especially the ones that pertain to what others value; the shadow type wants her to step back, see the big picture, discern important insights from the holistic images that come to her.\n\n\nIf Elizabeth, as the lead, refuses to listen to the quiet Kant, softly reminding her to look to the larger meaning in life, if he is figuratively exiled to her psychic tower of London, then she has gained absolute power to govern consciousness and a rebellious coup becomes inevitable. Kant will arm himself with mighty weapons from the unconscious and bring her to ignominious defeat.\n\nExtreme Extraverted Feeling\nExtraverted feeling carried to a one-sided extreme unduly associates the ego identity with the outer object. When extraverted feeling becomes too attached to the values and social norms of others, feeling is dispossessed of its own most valuable personal qualities. Feeling becomes too closely tied to the objects of its orientation; it loses its own natural validity - its natural charm and warmth.\n\n\'The subject [person] becomes so enmeshed in the network of individual feeling processes that to the observer it seems as though there were merely a feeling process and no longer a subject of feeling (CW 6, paragraph 596).\'\n\nAs the individual is pulled from one empathetic moment to another; the personal identity is lost in the affect of the moment. The identity is lost to collective values and the individual becomes what Holden Caulfield, the hero of Catcher in the Rye, called a \'phony.\'\n\n\'It becomes cold, \'unfeeling,\' untrustworthy. It has ulterior motives, or at least makes an impartial observer suspect them. It no longer makes that agreeable and refreshing impression which invariably accompanies genuine feeling; instead, one suspects a pose, or that the person is acting . . . (CW 6, paragraph 596)\'\n\nThe repressed shadow type [inferior function], introverted thinking, that essentially seeks truth and authenticity, will engender tyranny on the conscious stage. In the repression of the introverted attitudes, the individual loses access to that balance of opposites that only the collective unconscious (inner object) can provide as counterpoint to the allure of the world at large (outer object.) The ego itself is no match for the power of either the collective unconscious or the manifold world. The shadow attitude will bring its allies from the unconscious to oppose the extreme position.\n\nRather than the profound intellect of an Immanuel Kant, the repessed and ignore introverted thinking possesses \'infantile and archaic\' qualities. As conflictive antagonist, it delivers obsessive, intolerant, and shallow thoughts to depreciate everything that extraverted feeling most highly treasures. Shadow projections categorically reduce people to some sterile characterization. \'She is nothing but a social gadfly.\' \'He is nothing but a mechanic.\'\n\n\'The individual may be prone to \'...extravagant displays of feeling, gushing talk, loud expostulations, etc., which ring hollow . . . It is at once apparent that some kind of resistance is being overcompensated\' (CW 6, paragraph 599). The obsessively negative thoughts that plague the individual from the unconscious deliver unmanageable fears and emotional excesses."" - pages 224-227', 'http://www.handbagsonlinesalecheap.com/\nhttp://www.handbagsoutletonsalecheap.com/\nhttp://www.nikeshoesoutletonlinestore.com/\nhttp://www.timberlandshoesoutlet-buy.com/\nhttp://www.poloralphlaurenoutletssale.com/\nhttp://www.newbalanceoutletbuy.com/\nhttp://www.timberlandsoutletstore.com/\nhttp://www.poloralphlaurensale-outlet.com/\nhttp://www.nikeshoesonlineoutlet-sale.com/\nhttp://www.underarmouroutletshoesonsale.com/\n']","['Romantics ', 'ENFJ - Teacher', 'Personality']",ENFJ - Teacher

""CW 6"" = Collected Works of C.G. Jung, Psychological Types (book)\n\n\n""[dominant] Extraverted Sensation vs. [inferior] Introverted Intuition\nWhile extraverted sensation is oriented to the concrete, perceivable reality of particular objects, its opposite, introverted intuition, has the largest window to the big adn long-distance picture of life as a whole. A person oriented to extraverted sensation has a very keenly developed sense of outer reality. Naturally the individual will look suspiciously on intuitive hunches. While intuition readily sees three dots and connects twenty four, sensation will not connect one dot before it\'s time - before it is fully perceived. If is not perceived, it does not exist. Apprehending intuitively is a strange and dark art for this orientation. Apprehending the panoramic images of the inner object is a fearful proposition, for the inner object possesses none of the attributes perceivable by extraverted sensation; the inner object is strange and suspect. The more that introverted intuition is suppressed as worrisome by the dominant type, the more troublesome it becomes.\n\nJulia child, as extraverted sensation, who would \'rather eat one tablespoon of chocolate russe cake than three bowls of Jell-O!\' is opposed by the introverted intuition shadow played by Ghandi, who ate only the simplest foods and found fasting delicious. This could be a yeasty recipe of oppositions. A review of the five comparative categories for each type will help to illustrate this dynamic tension of opposites.\n\n\nTable 7-3 Se Opposed by Ni\nOrientations of\nSe: Extensive Facts ; Ni: Intensive Images\nComments on Orientation: The lead attends to the many individual, enjoyable, sensuous facts found in the world at large; the shadow type wants her to look inward to the delicious images that could also captivate her attention.\n\nAttitudes of\nSe: Perceive Facts ; Ni: Apprehend Images\nComments on Attitude: The lead is determined to get her facts just right, to accurately record every detail; the shadow type whispers that God is not in the details after all, but rather found in the inner life where the enthralling images that arise there are more real than real.\n\nFunctional Roles of\nSe: Realistic Sensation ; Ni: Visionary Intuition\nComments on Functional Role: The lead plays her role by savoring all the sensual delights of the moment, by being grounded in the practical issues of life; the shadow type wants her to join him in envisioning grand possibilities for the future.\n\nSubstances of\nSe: Outer Perceptions ; Ni: Inner Imagination\nComments on Substance: The lead considers her factual and accurate perceptions, she kneads them like dough; the shadow type wants her to get her fingers out of the dough of life and let her imagination rise.\n\nScopes of\nSe: Particular Facts ; Ni: Holistic Images\nComments on Scope: The lead enjoys each and every particular fact for its own sake; the shadow type wants her to relax and also enjoy images of the whole - the whole cake yes, but the whole life or whole world, even better.\n\n\nExtraverted sensation, fully oriented and directed to the outer object, is more engaged in the pure act of accurate perception than any of the other types. This both an adaptive advantage and a potential pitfall. The risk of a one-sided attitude, directed to the outer objects, is that it may fall into its grip, this repressing compensatory attitudes oriented to the inner object. The inner life can be too readily devalued in an exclusive absorption with sensory experience. What comes from inside will seem morbid and mysteriously unfamiliar, and therefore will likely be repressed.\n\nExtreme Extraverted Sensation\nWhen taken to an extreme, extraverted sensation conflates that ego identity with the outer object. Normally a highly sensitive type that differentiates the qualities of many sensuous experiences, in an extreme mode, it is driven to pure pleasure seeking. Extraverted sensation normally carries its own discriminating morality about sensuous experience. When too one-sided, it loses that discernment, \'squeezing dry\' sensuous experience, exploiting the outer object merely to further stimulate sensation.\n\nAll of life experience is blindly reduced to sensual perception; everything must have a concrete casual connection. \'[S]he will unhesitatingly connect a psychogenic symptom with a drop in the barometer . . . (CW 6, paragraph 607).\'\n\nGrandly imaginative introverted intuition asserts itself to actively oppose the conscious position, but in a primitive and disruptive form. It arrives as imagined anxieties, phobias, and magical superstitions. Extraverted sensation, the most practical, realistic, concrete form of ego consciousness, is besieged with preposterous suppositions. The most realistic and practical of all the types turns into a \'pathological parody\' of imagined troubles. As jealous suspicions and fantasies arise, the individual becomes increasingly petty and sanctimonious.\n\n\'A pettifogging captiousness follows, or a grotesquely punctilious morality combined with primitive, \'magical\' superstitions that fall back on abstruse rights . . . reason turns into hair-splitting pedantry, morality into dreary moralizing and blatant Pharisaism, religion into the ridiculous superstition, and intuition, the noblest gift of man, into meddlesome officiousness, poking into every corner; instead of gazing into the far distance, it descends to the lowest level of human meanness (CW 6, paragraph 608).\'\n\nThe individual is simultaneously in the grip of an obsessive tie to the outer object and overwhelmed by magical forces from within."" - pages 228-231', 'Hello I am a student at University and I am collecting data on Big-5, type indicator, and cluster B personality characteristics.

Jung Volume 6, Psychological Types (book)\n\n\n""[dominant] Extraverted Intuition vs. [inferior] Introverted Feeling or [inferior] Introverted Thinking\nA person oriented to extraverted intuition will tend to repress any aspect of consciousness that might obstruct his affection for possibilities in the making. He is loathe to consider practical detail that might impede his vision; nor does he want to hear the arguments about why his ideas are not feasible. The theoretical opposite of extraverted intuition is introverted sensing, yet introverted sensation, viewing sensory experience through the magical lens of the inner object [i.e. the focus of introversion], may not be a sufficient counterbalance. It is too similar to extraverted intuition; they share a common orientation to the inner object and they each value imagination. [The dominant focus of extraverted intuition is towards the object because of extraversion but intuition itself is argued by the author to focus on the inner world/object because it is perception via the unconscious which is postulated to be within people/mind, inside. While sensing is argued to be perception via physical senses thus taking in one\'s surroundings and focusing on the outer world/object. So he\'s saying while Ne is predominantly extraverted the fact that it has some introversion in it makes it not completely foreign to Si which is predominantly introversion focused with only a taste of extraversion from sensation.]\n\n\'Thinking and feeling, the indispensable components for conviction, are his inferior functions, carrying no weight and hence incapable of effectively withstanding the power of intuition. And yet these functions are the only ones that could compensate its supremacy by supplying judgment which the intuitive type totally lacks (CW 6, paragraph 613).\'\n\nBecause intuition is extraverted, the opposing shadow type(s) [inferior functions] would be expected to be introverted. For our purposes, we will assume they are, but extraverted rational functions could also serve as effective inhibitors of extraverted intuition, with their extraverted orientation to traditions, norms, and standards.\n\nAndrew Carnegie, the exuberant entrepreneur seeing and seizing possibilties to create wealth or make the world a better place, plays the role of extraverted intuition. The shadow role [inferior function] is often played by a rational function. Since Andy\'s role is extraverted, we would look to Anne Frank or Immanuel Kant for the shadow\'s introverted rational opposition.\n\n\nTable 7-4 Ne Opposed by Fi or Ti\nOrientations of\nNe: Extensive Possibilities ; Fi or Ti: Intensive Ideals or Insights\nComments on Orientation: The lead is open to new tangible possibilities in the world at large; the shadow type wants him to also consider intangible high ideals or eternally valid insights.\n\nAttitudes of\nNe: Perceive Possibilities ; Fi or Ti: Apprehend Ideals or Insights\nComments on Attitude: The lead moves from one possibility to another, the most exciting of them all being the next one, always the next one; the shadow type urges him to step off the treadmill of chasing possibilities and look to the images within that affirm enduring value and meaning beyond the treadmill of life.\n\nFunctional Roles of\nNe: Catalytic Intuition ; Fi or Ti: Idealistic Feeling or Conceptual Thinking\nComments on Functional Role: The lead is a catalyst for change - current circumstances never satisfy him; he always wants something better; the shadow type whispers that his ideals and philosophy will bring him peace of mind.\n\nSubstances of\nNe: Outer Imagination ; Fi or Ti: Inner Valuations or Thoughts\nComments on Substance: The lead is forever using his imagination to see how the outer world might change; the shadow type wants to direct his imagination to inner valuations and thoughts.\n\nScopes of\nNe: Particular Possibilities ; Fi or Ti: Holistic Ideals or Insights\nComments on Scope: The lead enjoys making particular possibilities real; the shadow type wants him to also see how those possibilities relate to the larger meaning of life.\n\n\nExtreme Extraverted Intuition\nWith an extreme disposition to extraverted intuition, the ego becomes too identified with unborn possibilities related to the outer object. It is in the grip of the vision of possibilities apprehended there. The ego identity merges with the perceived possibilities. The inflated ego can run roughshod over other compensating types; it becomes as grand, bold, and important as the possibilities themselves. Less imaginative people are secretly deprecated as contemptible, banal, or timid - only half alive; they are projections of his repressed shadow.\n\nNot prone to patience with the status quo, extraverted intuition thrusts the individual into a pursuit of the next enthralling possibility, each new one seemingly more important and alluring than the one before. He fancies a position of exalted superiority over the outer object. The individual ascends an uplifting spiral of self-importance with the ego conjoined to imagined possibilities. As those possibilities become grander, the ego inflates with them. Never mind that the last possibility was left incomplete and in shambles for lack of attention to practical detail. Life is not lived backward, but always thrust forward into the next imagined project or accomplishment. Like Napoleon abandoning his troops in Egypt, the individual figuratively sails away to pursue more exalted possibilities on the horizon.\n\nIf extraverted intuition becomes the exclusive sovereign of consciousness, the shadow type turns hostile and conspires to bring the inflated ego back to earth. The rational functions invade consciousness with infantile, archaic thoughts and feelings. The individual is rattled by hypochondriacal ideas, phobias, and bodily sensations. He falls victim to \'. . . neurotic compulsions in the form of over-subtle ratiocinations, hair-splitting dialectics, and a compulsive tie to the sensation aroused by objects\' (CW 6, paragraph 615)"" - pages 231-234', 'Nice!

The book gives a comprehensive introduction and overview to the functions of consciousness (""psychological types""), quoting from Carl Jung (the originator of the theory), and also has a basic introduction to Analytical Psychology - grounding the types theory from where it came. One of the the central tenets, if not the central tenet, in Analytical Psychology is individuation (i.e. personality growth/development, etc.) and I felt the author\'s final words were a solid goodbye and happy travels in your own journey in life.\n\n\n""The Big and Sacred Work\n\'The glory of God is the human person fully aware.\' - Irenaeus of Lyons\n\nWe humans are trapped precariously within an existential dilemma. We are delivered unannounced into a world from seeming darkness and perish into darkness in a comparative instant of time. From dust we come and to dust we return. In between we may pretend to have control, to know what we are doing or where we are going, but we are groping our way through sheer mystery.\n\nWe may try to stay \'present\' to the moment, yet there is no moment we could define as \'present.\' The very instant a future moment becomes the present moment it is lost as a past memory. There is no tangible moment to which we might stay present. We may exist in the infinitesimally thin silver of time that separates past from prologue.\n\nEverything about us is in the constant flux. None of the cells of our bodies remains with us. Each passes away, replaced by an intelligent and autonomous duplicate. The body we have in this moment is not the same body we have in the next moment. Our transport vehicle perpetually replaces itself with another one.\n\nWe experience life as though caught between two holograms. Outwardly, we perceive only the perceptible facade of what is truly there. Whatever it is, it is not what we think it is. We know only what we have been given to know. All else is concealed from our understanding. We might perceive the effects of gravity, but gravity itself is a mystery to us. We can perceive the dazzling starry galaxies in the night sky, but what we see may have been annihilated long before the dawn of our civilization; we will not know for a few million years.\n\nWe know nothing of the massive and enigmatic dark matter and dark energy that comprise far more of the night sky than we are able to see. Beyond what we can perceive and what we know must be there, we have no capacity for knowing what else might be present.\n\nInwardly, we are given dreams, visions, images, thoughts, aspirations, passions and conflicts. They too only represent a small fraction of the life beneath the surface of consciousness, and we only apprehend those images according to predetermined perceptual frameworks.\n\nSuch is our condition. We have one brief shining moment in time in which to understand and relate to the mystery of life. Many of us gloss over that mystery as we go about our busy and egocentric lives seeking to be more pleased than displeased.\n\nWe are the \'top animal exiled on a tiny speck of a planet in the Milky Way.\' The evolutionary descent of man from primordial sludge to the human animal may account for the history of biological form, but it does not account for the exponential leap in self-awareness, thought, religious urge, humor, or social conscience. What separates man from the cavalcade of evolutionary life? Personality.\n\nNo other species on our planet seems equipped with our consciousness of consciousness. We have no one here, other than ourselves, to discuss our personal condition. None of the living creatures in our world are intentionally building faith communities, creating constitutional laws, or probing epistemology. We have no one here from whom we might understand the nature and purpose of this life.\n\n\'That is the reason he does not know himself; he is cosmically isolated. He only can state with certainty that he is no monkey, no bird, no fish and no tree. But what he positively is, remains obscure (Serrano, 1968, p. 84).\'\n\nWe live in utter mystery. We may avoid our inquiry of that mystery, for the answers to our honest pursuit might appear too dangerous, too fearsome, or too unnerving. It is easier to simply adapt to the way of the herd, to look to answers given by others and accept them. Yet in choosing the way of the herd, we know that something dies within us. We join the \'mass of men,\' as Thoreau observed, living in \'quiet desperation.\'\n\n\'The more you cling to that which all the world desires, the more you are Everyman, who has not yet discovered himself and stumbles through the world like a blind man leading the blind with somnambulistic certainty into the ditch (CW 14, paragraph 192).\'\n\nThe alternative to the way of the herd is the way of individuation - the way that calls to us from unconscious depths. It is the long, slow way - neither easy nor expedient. Yet it is the way to the center where we may gain the certainties of the soul and the satisfaction of a life well lived.\n\n\'But in the end, the hero, the leader, the savior, is one who discovers a new way to greater certainty. Everything could be left undisturbed did not the new way demand to be discovered, and did it not visit humanity with all the plagues of Egypt until it finally is discovered. The undiscovered vein within us is a living part of the psychic; classical Chinese philosophy names this interior way \'Tao,\' and likens it to a flow of water that moves irresistibly towards its goals. To rest in Tao means fulfillment, wholeness, one\'s destination reached, one\'s mission done; the beginning, end, and perfect realization of the meaning of existence innate in all things. Personality is Tao (CW 17, paragraph 323).\'\n\nWe are endowed with a yearning to be part of something big and sacred. We may travel the world in search of acclaim or notoriety. We may devote our lives to certain causes and ambitions. Yet, this outward contribution to civilization \'will not be great or good, if the inward one is small or of little worth.\' Our greatest contribution will issue from pursuing that individuated way that is ours and ours alone to live.\n\nThe individual way is the big and sacred work that is given to each of us. If we wish to create something of enduring significance in the universe during our short sojourn in this world, we may find that eternally enduring significance in the individual that destiny calls us to become.\n\n\'I am neither spurred on by excessive optimism nor in love with high ideals, but am merely concerned with that fate of the individual human being - that infinitesimal unit on whom a world depends, and in whom, if we read the meaning of the Christian message alright, even God seeks his goal (CW 10, paragraph 113).\'"" - pages 274-277\n\n\nI love that third to last paragraph, ""We are endowed ..."", though one could just as easily call my resonance with it and the belief being promoted by the author as an introverted bias.', 'A century later, watchmaking had spread across the Jura mountain region of http://www.vetsonwhl.co.uk/vetsonwhl.html Switzerland, and by 1790, Geneva was already exporting over 60,000 timepieces.

177,221,Oppositions 4 Extra/Intro-verts,"['I posted the sections on the inferior functions (referred to by the author as ""oppositions"") for the eight functions throughout the forum. Here are the parts for Extraversion and Introversion. Book is ""Jung\'s Compass of Psychological Types"" by James Graham Johnston.\n\n\n""Extreme Oppositions\nIf the lead type [dominant function] takes an extreme position, the seat of the person\'s identity becomes too heavily invested in the object of the lead\'s orientation. If identity is excessively conflated with either the inner or outer object, the shadow type will be excessively repressed and a psychic tempest may ensue to correct the imbalance.\n\nFor extraverted and introverted types alike, the dilemma is the same: the bliss of following the conscious attitude must not become grandiose or extreme. An essential condition of individuation is to bring the shadow to greater consciousness.\n\nThe temptation for the extraverted types is to identify too much with the lively world at large. The temptation for the introverted types is to identify too much with the enthralling inner life. As the dominant attitude becomes imbalanced in either direction, the compensatory shadow\'s response, like the dwarf in the fairy tale [example from beginning of the chapter], disrupts the ego\'s intentions.\n\n\'It is an outstanding peculiarity of unconscious impulses that, when deprived of energy by lack of conscious recognition, they take on a destructive character, and this happens as soon as they cease to be compensatory (CW 6, paragraph 574).\'\n\nIf the shadow type [inferior function] is ignored or demeaned as an \'ugly imp,\' \'. . . the potentialities repressed by the [conscious] attitude will make themselves indirectly felt by disturbing the conscious conduct of life. When the disturbance reaches a definite pitch, we speak of neurosis\' (CW 6, paragraph 587). The ensuing neuroses seem purposefully intended to bring a halt to the ego\'s obstructively inflated position and to return the individual to a more balanced course.\n\nThis is the hazard of a superficial application of psychological types. The previous chapter presented the types as gifts, but only attending to one\'s strengths risks the neuroses that a one-sided attitude can bring.\n\nThe union of opposites, whether for introverted types or the extraverted types, is the way of individuation. We will address that union more fully in chapter 8 [""Becoming Whole""]. In this chapter [7, ""Oppositions""], addressing first the extraverted types then the introverted types, we will assess more fully the nature of the oppositions themselves. Our company of actors can help to \'put flesh\' on the conceptual bones of those oppositions, just as they did for the types themselves.\n\nOppositions for the Extraverted Types\nThe extraverted types, as a group, are opposed by introverted types. The opposition provides the necessary restraining influence to keep the lead type from getting carried away in excessive one-sidedness.\n\nShould the oppositional shadow fail to inhibit extreme one-sidedness, the shadow will intervene more disruptively on the stage of consciousness to undermine the ego\'s intentions. Jung referred to that more aggressive disruption as neurosis.\n\nThough neurosis for each of the extraverted types will have its particular attributes, for the extraverted types generally, we can expect to see an imbalanced identification with the world at large. Jung referred to it as \'hysteria.\'\n\n\'The hallmark of classic hysteria is an exaggerated rapport with persons in the immediate environment and an adjustment to surrounding conditions that amounts to imitation. A constant tendency to make himself interesting and to produce an impression is a basic feature of the hysteric (CW 6, paragraph 566).\'\n\nThe shadow will bring the grand extraverted imbalance to an unceremonious halt.\n\n\'This [nervous breakdown] invariably happens when the influence of the unconscious finally paralyzes all conscious action (CW 6, paragraph 573).\'\n\nFor each of the types that follow, we will present the healthy oppositional tension first, and then the neurotic condition if the type adopts an extreme, one-sided position.\n\n[...]\n\nOppositions for the Introverted Types\nWhen the introverted types go too far, too much identifying with archetypal images, the ego\'s importance is fancifully inflated, assuming an illusion of power or superiority. The dwarf-like extraverted shadow will cast its spell, throwing the introverted ego between the rock and hard spot of the very mundane world it seeks to devalue, enslaving the ego to the facts of life.\n\n\'The individual\'s freedom of mind is fettered by the ignominy of his financial dependence, his freedom of action trembles in the face of public opinion, his moral superiority collapses in a morass of inferior relationships, and his desire to dominate ends in a pitiful craving to be loved (CW 6, paragraph 626).\'\n\nThe neuroses generated on this side of the great divide will be in response to a grandiose over-identification with the eternal images of the collective unconscious.\n\n[...]\n\nOne-sided Organizational Cultures\nAn understanding of the disruptive consequences of extreme types applies not only to individuals but also to groups. Just as individuals can generate neuroses and compulsive complexes by taking their type dispositions to an extreme, so too can any association of people organized toward a common end - corporations, associations, societies, faith communities; they can generate disruptive strife by becoming typologically one-sided.\n\nA corporation that seeks a unified one-sided culture congruent with the CEO\'s dominant type, for example, may bring up disruptive shadow interventions. A society of psychotherapists might generate acrimonious division and conflict by taking its composite introverted feeling orientation too seriously. A faith community, too one-sided in a dogmatic orientation to religious beliefs, may induce the shadow to rise up and take it down, either through internal conflict or the impeachable lives of its leaders. A community of academics, too one-sided toward introverted thinking, might become petty and vindictive as the shadow exacts its revenge.\n\nThe organization is only as strong and healthy as the diversely individuated lives of the people who compromise it. The solution for all of these kinds of organizational one-sidedness is always the same: pursuing the unique and authentic middle way of individuation for each person in the organization.\n\nThe vitality of organizations depends on the vitality of each individual in the organization. The greater the individuation among the people, the more vital, dynamic, balanced, and healthy the organization becomes.\n\n\'It is obvious that a social group consisting of stunted individuals cannot be a healthy and viable institution; only a society that can preserve its internal cohesion and collective values, while at the same time granting the individual the greatest possible freedom, has any prospect of enduring vitality (CW 6, paragraph 758).\'\n\nChapter Summary\nThe path to individuation is not a well-paved superhighway. The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune are sometimes inaugurated by one-sidedness. The Self seeks wholeness; the personality unifies the many potential identities of the psyche. If too much importance is invested in an inflated identity on either side of the great divide, the other side will rise up to bring it down. The greater the pride or pretense, the greater the fall.\n\nThe way of individuation is to neither one extreme nor another, but to the middle - the way between the opposites. Individuation progressively moves the seat of personal identity from the one-sided ego to the centered Self. Individuation occurs as we progressively discover the middle way and become whole."" - pages 216-218 & 234-235 & 246-247', 'I ended up including the section on ""Organizational Cultures"" for shits and giggles.']","['General Myers Briggs', 'Personality']",Personality

They are Bully for Brontosaurus - Reflections in Natural History by Stephen Jay Gould 1991, Evolutionary Biology and Human Social Behavior: An Anthropological Perspective by Napoleon A. Chagnon and William Irons 1979, and Marx, Durkheim, Weber - Formations of Modern Social Thought by Ken Morrison 1995.\n\nBully for Brontosaurus: This is a collection of essays. They are on various scientific topics but are well written. Gould takes care to explain his views for the average reader. I like his analysis of the origins of modern man (homo sapiens). It is thought-provoking that different groups of people, the ancestors of us all, traveled by foot to the farthest reaches of the globe. I should, since they are mentioned in the title, write that dinosaurs also represent a great topic for discussion. I feel that the word ""dinosaurs"" is used at times instead of the word ""paleontology."" Brontosaurus and even Ultrasaurus are, of course, some of the large herbivorous reptiles known to have existed some 65 million years ago. Ours is a fruitful planet, laden with briny seas, oxygen-producing algae, forests, and massively differing waves of organisms. Significantly, I think, to us is the cold of the ice ages. Perhaps the cyclical presence of these conglomerations of glaciers and ice caused there to be less food for the grazing, herbivorous creatures, and thus less prey for the carnivorous ones. The mastodons lasted, though, for some time as did the American horses both of which are now extinct. (Today and in the recent past, humans have used horses originating from the ""Old World."" Of course the dinosaurs did not go extinct due to simple glaciation. We now know that a meteor struck our planet, causing dust to cloud the atmosphere. Since the ages of the dinosaurs mammals have really prospered...especially simian ones. And I think of the shared behavior of tool-making and Koko\'s Kitten. Koko is a female gorilla that learned some sign language and adopted a kitten. Tools are everywhere, now, including tools that make tools!\n\nEvolutionary Biology and Human Social Behavior: I am a fan of Napoleon Chagnon. He has researched the Yanomamo tribe in Venezuela/Brazil for decades. His study of these Native American hunter-gatherers is a powerful indication of the similarity of humans despite differences in their social organization and behavior patterns. This book is deep and scientific and I continue to enjoy reading it.\n\nMarx, Durkheim, Weber: This is a salient, thought-provoking book. It is a challenge to describe briefly the ideas it holds. I guess I should say it talks about team play, the use and distribution of resources within a society, and yes, religion. This book poses questions about why we do the things we do and support social and economic behavior patterns that have remained much the same for a long time. It has been a while since I took Sociology but I will read this book carefully to refresh my memory.\n\nPlease share your own books, research and views on art and science.

179,223,Introverted thinking and its oppositions,"['The section on introverted thinking and its inferior functions (""oppositions"") from the book ""Jung\'s Compass of Psychological Types"" by James Graham Johnston. Actors are used as examples to illustrate the qualities of the function in question, that is to say that the persons mentioned showed attributes akin to that of the paired function associated by the author and not that they necessarily had that as their dominant function. Furthermore, no one person is a ""type""; the functions are conceptually ""types"", it\'s argued that people have all the functions and only have them developed and/or expressed to different degrees.\n\n\n""[dominant] Introverted Thinking vs. [inferior] Extraverted Feeling\nA person disposed to introverted thinking with extraverted feeling as the shadow type [inferior function] tends to feel shy, awkward, and ill equipped for social interaction. The more people present, the less he likes it. Social relationships drain his energy. He is a stranger to small talk. Though he may get worked into a passionate fervor discussing, with like-minded associates, some philosophical problem, he will tire of talking too much with people about their lives or the commonplace events of the day. His feeling side is little evolved; he finds empathy difficult. It is easier for him to understand relationships conceptually from the lofty perspective of the head than to either feel or express feelings from the heart.\n\nGood Queen Bess [Elizabeth I]. as extraverted feeling, will play the role of compensatory opposite to the lead, played by Immanuel Kant. He is forever lost in thought, only partially aware of the goings on around him. He just wants people to leave him alone so that he can intensively pursue his unifying ideas and philosophy. Elizabeth would have him spend more time as social gatherings, attend the opera or the theater, stay in touch with people and with what they value. She would have him be less of a hermit and more of a social butterfly. A review of their attributes, using our comparative categories, will help to make this tension of opposites more clear.\n\n\nTable 7-5 Ti Opposed by Fe\nOrientations of\nTi: Intensive Insights ; Fe: Extensive Norms\nComments on Orientation: The lead type [dominant function] has his eye intensively on emerging new ideas and insights; the shadow type [inferior function] has her eye on people protocol, norms, and traditions.\n\nAttitudes of\nTi: Apprehend Insights ; Fe: Perceive Norms\nComments on Attitude: The lead type chases insights all day long, somewhat oblivious to the people, practical details, or social customs unrelated to his insights; the shadow type wants to affirm tradition, to attend to practical detail, to support social harmony and norms.\n\nFunctional Roles of\nTi: Conceptual Thinking ; Fe: Social Feeling\nComments on Functional Role: The lead type applies his thinking philosophically, seeking conceptual clarity for the inner images and ideas he beholds; the shadow type would have him empathizing with people and mingling about, feeling his way from one social gathering to another.\n\nSubstances of\nTi: Inner Thoughts ; Fe: Outer Valuations\nComments on Substance: The lead type thinks with thoughts about the inner object; the shadow type feels with feeling-toned valuations about the outer objects.\n\nScopes of\nTi: Holistic Insights ; Fe: Particular Norms\nComments on Scope: The lead type wants to focus on the holistic insights that he is apprehending inwardly; the shadow type would have him focus on outward detail, especially the ones that pertain to what others value.\n\n\nThe relationship between these two is amicable, as long as the lead does not become too identified with the inner object. The shadow type plays a quiet compensatory role as an inferior role. The opposition is noticeable but not overwhelming. The individual often lacks social grace or attention to social norms, and may seem distant and remote. The shadow type, over time, will change all that, integrating an awareness of norms and values, increasingly enhancing the individual\'s social skills. But if the ego\'s lead introverted thinking becomes too much identified with the inner object, then the shadow type will gather the forces of the unconscious in a conflict to upend the dominant position.\n\nExtreme Introverted Thinking\nWith extreme one-sidedness, the ego is unduly commingled with the ideas and truths discovered in the collective unconscious. The person\'s identity is conflated with the inner object. \'He begins to confuse his subjective truth with his own personality\' (CW 6, paragraph 636).\n\nWith an exclusive orientation to the inner object, naturally the outer object loses importance and attention. The images and ideas of the inner object are indeed enthralling, but they take on an independent life of their own. No longer do they easily link up with the facts of the world or practical applications; they are sought after for their own sake. The connections between ideas and practical facts get lost. Thoughts, detached from the facts of the outer objects, take on mythological qualities.\n\nOne-sided thinking taken to an extreme discriminates against all objective facts that do not fit with its treasured truth. The more one-sided the thinking, the more the identity gets lost in the mythological images of the inner object. \'It creates theories for their own sake . . . with a distinct tendency to slip over from the world of ideas to mere imagery\' (CW 6, paragraph 630).\n\nRepresentations of the archetypal unconscious are indeed enthralling and inspiring. They represent that which is eternally valid and true. Yet introverted thinking must allow the other complimentary attitudes of consciousness to connect those universal truths to the practical issues of life.\n\nIf ignored, the outer object, so coldly rejected, begins to attack from within. He begins to obsess about things that, to others, seems utterly unimportant. The individual also may lose his social bearings. He can be prone to troublesome social relationships and reckless value judgments.\n\nThe individual becomes increasingly isolated and temperamental. His touchiness further isolates him from the very people who could help him compensate for his one-sidedness. His tone becomes surly: \'[H]e will burst out with vicious, personal retorts against every criticism however just. Thus his isolation gradually increases. His originally fertilizing ideas become destructive, poisoned by the sediment of bitterness\' (CW 6, paragraph 636). The individual increasingly loses touch with concrete reality as his plagued with phobias, obsessive compulsions, and anxiety."" - pages 235-238']","['Creators', 'Personality', 'ISTP - Crafter']",ISTP - Crafter

These include but are not limited to the continued development of satellite and communications technology, diplomacy between astronauts of different national origins, the testing of super computers and microprocessors at zero gravity and the peace of mind of knowing that homo sapiens live beyond our planet.\nThe Hubble telescope (which was repaired in space by astronauts) and now the Kepler telescope have provided us with invaluable knowledge about the physics, chemistry and otherwise previously unknown features of the deep cosmos. We now know there are hundreds of Earth-like planets orbiting sun-like stars in neighboring solar systems.\n--There may be other phenomena close to us such as dark stars or nemesis stars along with radically elliptical orbit-holding gaseous, rogue, giant planets in our own solar system similar in constitution to Jupiter.--R.Dean\nI feel that a large-scale permanent space station would better assist astrophysicists in early warning and diversion of asteroids and meteor showers approaching our planet. Even better would be a infrared or radar array that surrounds the earth. The same goes for small settlements on the moon and Mars. We have a long way to go to reach the level of technological advancement theorized in the Star Trek TV shows and movies. I heard on YouTube that if astronauts approached one half of light speed and maintained their velocity at that degree for one year, they would return to an Earth several decades ahead of the time that they departed. Einstein argued that surpassing light speed is impossible. I think a space craft could still travel extremely fast without breaking his axiom. What does this mean? I'm sure that humanity will return to the moon and eventually Mars. But I hope they do it in a big wave of international teamwork, guaranteeing that it won't be a limited expedition like the original manned space program. It is amazing to see the images brought back by Hubble and Kepler. I can only imagine what secrets the deep universe and its conglomeration of various shaped and colored galaxies holds for us."", 'http://www.raybans-outlet.cc/, http://www.ray-bans.net.co/, http://www.swarovski-canada.ca/, http://www.coach-factoryoutlet.net.co/, http://www.bottegaoutlet.com/, http://www.reebok-shoes.co.uk/, http://www.oakleys-online.com.co/, http://www.adidassuper-star.com.de/, http://www.michaelkorsviponline.com/, http://www.lacosteoutlet.com.co/, http://www.uggsboots.com.de/, http://www.pandora-jewellery.com.es/, http://www.oakleys.com.de/, http://www.ralphlaurens-outlet.net/, http://lions.nfl-jerseys.org/, http://rockets.nbajerseysvip.com/, http://www.nikeshoes.fr/, http://www.nikefreerun-inc.co.uk/, http://www.thomas-sabos.com.de/, http://www.mcm-backpacks.com.co/, http://www.guessfactorys.com/, http://www.raybanvip.com/, http://raptors.nbajerseysvip.com/, http://www.outlet-toryburchshoes.com/, http://www.thomas-sabo.us.com/, http://www.nike-free-runs.de/, http://www.hermesbagsoutlet.com/, http://www.michael-korsbags.com.co/, http://www.jeans-truereligion.com/, http://www.adidas-shoes.com.co/, http://www.converses.us.com/, http://www.longchamp-bagsoutlet.com/, http://www.nike-store.com.de/, http://eagles.nfl-jerseys.org/, http://www.adidasschuhe-online.com.de/, http://www.newiphone-cases.com/, http://www.nikefree5.com.co/, http://hawks.nbajerseysvip.com/, http://www.danskos-shoes.com/']","['Science & Technology', 'General Topics']",General Topics
181,225,Introverted Feeling and its oppositions,"['The section on introverted feeling and its inferior functions (""oppositions"") is from the book ""Jung\'s Compass of Psychological Types"" by James Graham Johnston. Actors are used as examples to illustrate the qualities of the function in question, that is to say that the persons mentioned showed attributes akin to that of the paired function associated by the author and not that they necessarily had that as their dominant function. Furthermore, no one person is a ""type""; the functions are conceptually ""types"", it\'s argued that people have all the functions and only have them developed and/or expressed to different degrees.\n\n\n""[dominant] Introverted Feeling vs. [inferior] Extraverted Thinking\nA person disposed to introverted feeling with an extraverted thinking shadow type [inferior function] may feel at a loss to create order, make decisions quickly, or work skillfully with practical problem solving. It can be difficult to physically order things, data, processes, or logistics. The physical sciences have little appeal. People are the chief interests; an interest in things, data, numbers, facts, or physical systems comes reluctantly if it arrives at all.\n\nThe reflective Anne Frank plays the role of introverted feeling; so sensitive, with such poignant observations and personal understanding well beyond her years, she illustrates well the depth of feeling and the stubborn independence that are often the attributes of this type. She is balanced by Charles Darwin, playing the role of extraverted thinking. He assembles many facts to derive his logical conclusions about the world he observes.\n\nThe two form a healthy opposition in the psyche, Charles holding Anne in check from too much one-sided identification with the ideals she has apprehended. The aim of individuation is to become whole, not to rely on a one-sided orientation to consciousness. Her penchant for quietly trusting her ideals, for feeling with deep affect what is most important in life is balanced by his reliance on outward facts that can be ordered by the power of unaffected logic.\n\n\nTable 7-6 Fi Opposed by Te\nOrientations of\nFi: Intensive Ideals ; Te: Extensive Order\nComments on Orientation: The lead [dominant function] attends to images and ideals; the shadow type [inferior function] encourages her to just stick to the facts.\n\nAttitudes of\nFi: Apprehend Ideals ; Te: Perceive Order\nComments on Attitude: The lead is forever writing to her imaginary friend \'Kitty\' [Frank\'s journal] to share her reflective feelings and observations; the shadow type would have her see to the housework, take care of her things, keep the kitchen in good working order.\n\nFunctional Roles of\nFi: Idealistic Feeling ; Te: Constructive Thinking\nComments on Functional Role: The lead wants to bask in the beauty of the stars, to make a contribution in the world, to feel that she is living true to her ideals; the shadow type would rather see her construct an orderly, realistic life than to chase ideals born from the stars.\n\nSubstances of\nFi: Inner Valuations ; Te: Outer Thoughts\nComments on Substance: The lead dwells on feeling-toned valuations of inner images; the shadow type would have her think more logically about practical matters.\n\nScopes of\nFi: Holistic Ideals ; Te: Particular Order\nComments on Scope: The lead type enjoys basking in very big-picture inner images; the shadow type would have her stay focused on the order she could derive from particular facts.\n\n\nThe two form a healthy pair with the dumbling Darwin, weak and primitive, doing his best to serve as foil to a dreamy attachment to the inner object. He will insert himself to trip her up, hold her back, give her second thoughts about this ideal or hesitations about that lofty pursuit, but he will not oppose her aggressively. Should she not listen tot he softly whispered practical admonitions, should she go overboard and identify too much with the powerful images that for her are eternal ideals, then he will become her insidious saboteur, openly undermining all that she holds dear. She, as the ego\'s favored disposition, feel she is the inner object.\n\nExtreme Introverted Feeling\nWhen the ego becomes one with the object of its orientation, the individual assumes too much power and self-importance. She becomes bossy and domineering for \'. . . the mysterious power of the intensive feeling turns into a banal and overweening desire to dominate, into vanity and despotic bossiness\' (CW 6, paragraph 642).\n\nNow the dumbling becomes a demon, for it must take extreme measures to subvert an ego position that has gone too far. As introverted feeling is too attached to the inner object, extraverted thinking creates obsessive attachments the other way - in the outer object: \'\'. . . introverted feeling is counterbalanced by a primitive thinking, whose concretism and slavery to facts surpass all bounds\' (CW 6, paragraph 639).\n\nThe otherwise meekly developed thinking turns powerfully negative, demeaning everything and everyone that introverted feeling might normally value; lofty ideals and admirable people are demeaned with thoughts of \'nothing but\': \'She is nothing but a social climber.\' \'He is nothing but an obsequious charlatan.\'\n\nExtraverted thinking is insidiously projected onto others. People are imagined to be thinking all kinds of malignant thoughts and schemes. The individual grows increasingly suspicious; combative rivalries ensue. Soon she believes that no one can be trusted and she must defend her bitter opinions with every weapon in her arsenal. She may cheapen every ideal and warp every virtue to defeat the wicked imagined enemy. She believes that she, and she alone, represents the true wellspring of eternal ideals with which her life is now inextricably entangled. Neurosis is the inevitable consequence of her inflated ego and she is subdued with fatigue, anxiety, and depression."" - pages 238-240', 'Very interesting analysis! I especially enjoy it because I am a strong NF. I don\'t think Darwin or Darwinians are demons, though. It is sad, too, that Anne Frank and much of her family and friends were killed by Nazis in World War II. I must say this brings to my mind the issue of ethnocentrism. What would Darwin say about ethnocentrism? I\'ll bet he\'d say it is not healthy for the intermingling and continuation of our species (homo sapiens). Ethnocentrism is a stage of consciousness on the Spiral Dynamics consciousness chart. This is a stage on a chart just like Freud\'s childhood stages and Maslow\'s actualizational stages. Darwin was very scientific and logical because that was his way of processing social information but, also, the avant garde culture of the mid- to late-1800\'s was scientific and less-romantic than, for example, the Renaissance of Michelangelo, Vivaldi and Shakespeare.\nI\'m no orchestra master but I can hear the difference in the cultures when I listen to Mozart and then Beethoven. Some historical atlases (I think historical atlases are awesome) show people coming in from the fields to work in the cities during Darwin\'s and Marx\'s time. Hence the new (for the 1800\'s) intensification of focus on wage-scales, industrial development, steam engines, and later assembly lines (Fordism is also mentioned in some Spiral Dynamics Charts.) Darwin would appreciate, I think, The Jungle by Upton Sinclair. Using the Darwin/Frank dichotomy. Darwin would not care so much about the living conditions of this or that ethnicity, this or that race. He would care about the fair treatment, living and working conditions of all the people met by the protagonist in The Jungle. The centuries are spiking! What do I mean? What took over a thousand years of agrarian development, shifted to industrial for a few centuries only. Then came modernism or Fordism (into the 1950\'s), followed by post-modernism...roughly starting after WWII with the Baby Boom (thinking outside the box in the 1960\'s), Jackson Pollock, Marc Chagall and again Andy Warhol. Then comes integral consciousness and post-integral consciousness. Darwin would (I hope) approve of the evolution and ongoing change transcending his own logical, scientific intensification. His E and T would still be valid, extant and dominant. But the direction and needs of the people around him might no longer be definable by logic and science (or pragmatism alone). He wouldn\'t, I think, want the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer. This would be a return to the big-industry guys of the late 1800\'s and early 1900\'s. Importantly (to me) a Darwin of today wouldn\'t want the literati or cognate and those in-the-know to horde their knowledge while larger masses remain in the dark. I think of the crusade of Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the 1950\'s followed by the successes of the once blacklisted Dalton Trumbo. McCarthy\'s Cold War-associated attack on Communism would fail. Hence, too, the success of Arthur Miller\'s The Crucible (an allegory for the McCarthy hearings). Another good book is George Orwell\'s Animal Farm. In it the characterizations of abusive Leninists say ""All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others."" In the 1970\'s would come I\'m OK - You\'re OK which is also a good read. Darwin would approve of the work of W.E.B. Dubois, Durkheim and Weber. All of whom I am still reading. I think Darwin would also like Philip Zimbardo\'s research on aggression, competition, superiority/inferiority (two sides of the same coin) and the subjugation of the have-nots by the haves. Anne Frank would in turn benefit from the logic of Darwin. She probably never read or enjoyed the Origin of Species or discussed it with friends and family.', ""What an interesting mesh of ideas!\n\nPhillip Zimbardo is a contemporary psychologist to anyone who's interested.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3oIiH7BLmg\n\nThanks for introducing me to something new (Spiral Dynamics).""]","['Romantics ', 'Personality', 'INFP - Healer']",INFP - Healer
182,226,Thoughts about Thinking,"[""There are many ways that a person can think. Here are some summaries of thinking categories circulating on the Internet. Thanks to Ken Wilber, Descartes, Freud, Skinner, Gadamer and Marx.\n\nArtistry/Work and Art Criticism/Work Compensation Thinking: Art and work have long undergone subjective and objective criticism and evaluation. Art and work are analyzed by criteria possessed by a second party or audience, separate in identity from the artist or worker. Thus there are three things involved: The artist, the piece of work and the evaluator (observer).\nIt is the artist's intention to meet as much of the criteria held by the evaluator befitting a good, inspiring job. This is a small-scale, person-to-person social contract. The artist wants a win-win outcome.\nIt is the evaluator's (observer's) intention to see that his/her subjective or objective criteria have been met. Ergo, that the piece of work is good and inspiring. The evaluator wants gradated (if/then) outcomes. These could be, for example, if the art is truly inspiring then the observer will compensate the artist generously, subsequently if the art is substandard then the observer will compensate the artists less-generously. The freedom of the evaluator to decide on the degree of compensation for the artist's work is an important element of the social transaction contract.\nThis is essentially a quid pro quo way of thinking.\n\nPast, Present and Future Thinking: This is a way of thinking that represents different cultural leanings. Focusing on the past or the good old days can be nice but may lead to the phenomenon of sitting-on-your-laurels. Focusing on the present can be Dionysian or self-indulging (living for the moment.) Focusing on the future can be good because it requires the individual to set priorities based on Maslow's hierarchy of actualizational needs and establish a plan of action accordingly.\n\nLow-causal Thinking: This is a sort of meditative process of contemplation and seeking of awareness of the eternal in all of us. Some may see Brahma, others Buddha, others a field of light and warmth, etc.\n\nHigh-causal Thinking: This is another sort of meditative process that is more transcending of specific deities or God images. It is a sort of Nir-vana or no-thingness that reflects a more subdued, selfless, egoless consciousness. I imagine the vastness of the deep cosmos, even beyond galaxies, as it were.\n\nNondual Thinking: This is a way of seeing reality as a nondual union of emptiness and forms. Dependent, co-arising elements of self, others and other things in the universe becomes observable.\n\nCartesian Dualism Thinking: The physical brain and the mind's conscious processing of interior and exterior stimuli or qualia are not one and the same. This is a centuries-old, ongoing philosophical study of mind-body differences. There are quite a few opinions on this.\n\nBig Mind Thinking: Transcending the ego or the self with all its material needs and goals, this meditative quest seeks an awareness of the blessed, divine or eternal in all people, things, etc. Dennis Merzel talks in depth about a reverence or respect for the ongoing process of life and being alive and conscious. He also mentions focusing on a rapport of love emerging from the heart and the head for self and others, too.\n\nShadow Consciousness Thinking: This is a focused searching for the underlying meaning behind perceived emotional, physical states, such as fear. A person, while meditating, may feel fear and need to realize after some time that it is anger that has been suppressed or sublimated into the deep subconscious. This is also a subject of ongoing discussion on the Internet.\n\nThere are many other ways of thinking. I look forward to learning more about the ones listed here and others, too."", ""I think you have put a lot of thought into this, and I find that very interesting. Looking at these different thought types, it seems that we uses many of them given the circumstances we find ourselves in, yet I've never really tried to identify my thought type within a given situation. I'm afraid I'm not adequately prepared to provide any meaningful input here, but I do appreciate the topic you've created!""]","['General Topics', 'Spirituality & Philosophy']",Spirituality & Philosophy
183,227,Introverted Intuition and its oppositions,"['The following section is on the inferior function (""opposition"") of introverted intuition from the book ""Jung\'s Compass of Psychological Types"" by James Graham Johnston. Actors are used as examples for the functions in question, particularly dominant and inferior ones.\n\n\n""[dominant] Introverted Intuition vs. [inferior] Extraverted Sensation\nA person oriented to introverted intuition with extraverted sensation as the shadow type [inferior function] will usually have much diffificulty with concrete, practical reality. So lofty is his vision that he fins it difficult to keep his feet on the ground. One joke about these oppositions goes: \'If he is told to hit the ground, he\'ll miss.\' So enthralled with the big picture of life and the long distance view of the world, his ability to be attentively present here and now is barely developed. His mind is always elsewhere, in pursuit of imaginative visions in the inner life. Practical reality stumps him; he only awkwardly and timidly makes his way in the world. He may forever be misplacing things, forgetting appointments, or running late. He addresses the practical requirements of life with great difficulty; he may try to simplify his life in the world to reduce the distractions that keep him from his treasured inner life.\n\nThe Indian ascetic Mahatma Gandhi plays the leading role [dominant function] of introverted intuition, the type without which \'there would have been no prophets in Israel.\' Julia Child, so engaged in the sensual pleasures of life, will oppose Gandhi as extraverted sensation. He will strive to keep his head in the archetypal clouds of eternal truths; she will seek to keep his feet firmly on the terra firma of the concretely real world at large. A review of the five comparative categories for each type will help to illuminate the tension of opposites at work.\n\n\nTable 7-8 Ni Opposed by Se\nOrientations of\nNi: Intensive Images ; Se: Extensive Facts\nComments on Orientation: The lead is oriented to intensive images within; the shadow type is oriented to many facts without.\n\nAttitudes of\nNi: Apprehend Images ; Se: Perceive Facts\nComments on Attitude: The lead is content to apprehend and fully appreciate the inner images; the shadow type wants him to stick to the facts.\n\nFunctional Roles of\nNi: Visionary Intuition ; Se: Realistic Sensation\nComments on Functional Role: The lead envisions grand possibilities for the future of humanity; the shadow type would have him delight in the pleasures and practical needs of the moment.\n\nSubstances of\nNi: Inner Imagination ; Se: Outer Perceptions\nComments on Substance: The lead works with his inner imagination; the shadow type would have him also work with accurate perception of the world.\n\nScopes of\nNi: Holistic Images ; Se: Particular Facts\nComments on Scope: The lead enjoys images of the whole; the shadow type also beckons him to focus on each particular fact.\n\n\nExtreme Introverted Intuition\nIntroverted intuition is normally holistic in scope, seeing a vast panorama of events; it is intensively oriented to the inspiring images arising in the inner life. In an extreme position, the ego grows attached to the grand visions apprehended within, this conflating the person\'s identity with the archetypal images of the collective unconscious.\n\nThe normally aloof individual becomes even more isolated as he becomes more one-sided. Lost in the swirl of alluring archetypal imagery, he becomes a complete enigma to people well-adapted to the world. The images apprehended from the unconscious may have little connection to daily standards, norms, or practical requirements of life.\n\nThe person may become content just to apprehend the cavalcade of visions alive in the inner life, losing himself to archetypal imagery. With the repression of the outer object, he essentially lives in a world that others cannot understand.\n\n\'. . . he remains uncomprehended. His language is not the one currently spoken - it has become too subjective. His arguments lack the convincing power of reason. He can only profess or proclaim. His is \'the voice of one carrying in the wilderness\' (CW 6, paragraph 662).\'\n\nThe extreme imbalance is openly opposed by the renegade shadow type, usually extraverted sensation. It disrupts the conscious focus on the inner life with obsessions about many facts and details, each having exaggerated importance. The individual will often suffer from compulsions and hypochondria."" - pages 244-246', 'Once again, good stuff! Gandhi and Julia Child...hmm. It is true that INFJ\'s like Gandhi and myself must take care not to come across as esoteric and preachy. Hence I suggest a common ground between the gourmand, bon vivant, Julia Childs (Dionysian/Fox) and the socially abstract, non-violent revolutionary, Mahatma Mohandas Gandhi (Apollonian/Dolphin).\nI looked up some Sociology terms. These are four categories of Norms. Norms are a common, social phenomenon existing in all human cultures.\n\nFolkways: Folkways are customs. They regulate tradition and convenience. Examples would be; ""Don\'t belch at the dinner table."" and one I remember is ""Don\'t leave your chopsticks sticking up in the rice.""\nIf a folkway is broken there are no legal or moral consequences.\n\nMores: Mores are strict norms that regulate moral and ethical behavior. Examples would be; ""Don\'t disrupt the church service."" and ""Don\'t have sex before marriage."" If a more is broken observers or friends and family may feel that their morals have been violated and take offense.\n\nTaboos: Taboos are norms that society holds very strongly. Violating a taboo results in extreme disgust. The violator may be considered to be unfit to live in that society. Examples of taboo violation would be incest and cannibalism.\n\nLaws: Laws are norms that are written down and enforced by an official law enforcement agency. Violating a law may result in a citation, fine and/or incarceration. Examples of law violation would be driving while drunk, theft, murder and trespassing.\n\nGandhi struggled to end the occupation of what would be India, West Pakistan, East Pakistan (Bangladesh), Hyderabad, Upper and Lower Burma (Myanmar) and Bengal, Punjab, Kashmir, Mumbai, et cetera by the British Empire. He was arrested and incarcerated for breaking the law on more than one occasion in his life. Gandhi himself was a lawyer educated in Oxford. It was illegal to attempt to disband or bring down the British control of these ""countries,"" as well as to speak out and protest the mistreatment of workers by British industrialists, encourage civil disobedience, and gather in large groups, as it were. He probably had little time for his family life, which is unfortunate, and probably as well was a source of tension. He must have counted on his family and friends frequently for practical guidance. I\'m sure that Julia Child knew of Gandhi. Child and Gandhi would probably like the book that is called Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert. The title is a reference to ways of living in Italy, India and Indonesia.\nAnother interesting dichotomy or social relationship is that which existed between Gandhi and Winston Churchill! In his lifetime Churchill saw his country\'s empire shrink to pretty much what it is today. And he had to broadcast personally to keep it even that large during the second world war. India with its homespun cloth wheel flag would be officially recognized in 1948, only a few years after the close of World War II. Hong Kong would also be returned to China in 1997.\nI caught a few of Julia Child\'s TV shows and always thought they were inspiring. Also this the case for Bob Ross the painter! They would enjoy meeting with Gandhi and sharing/comparing their views on life, living, consciousness and the rapidly changing status of the world\'s populations. Julia Child might express concern about remaining hunger around the world. Bob Ross would encourage imperialists, like Churchill, to appreciate art more often, etc.\nI admit to sharing many of Gandhi\'s and other INFJ\'s aloofness, esoteric-ness and otherwise wool-gathering. I did savor my dessert, though. It was creamy yoghurt with strawberries!']","['Romantics ', 'Personality', 'INFJ - Counselor']",INFJ - Counselor

185,229,Book Review - Out of Mao's Shadow 2008,"[""Out of Mao's Shadow - The Struggle for the Soul of a New China by Philip P. Pan 2008: This is a complex book that is broad in scope. I am enjoying reading it. The legacy of Communist leader Mao Tse Tung has endured for decades. I must emphasize the difference between theoretical Marxism and military Leninism.\nAlthough Joseph Stalin's strong-arm era of cultural and economic dominance in what was the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has passed, and the so-called Bi-Polar, hot & cold dilemma of the Cold War is dissolved, there yet remain large portions of the globe and human population that are living under military Leninism.\nThis, military, authoritarian, control of economy and culture reflects a desire to equalize previous disparities between haves and have-nots. The same could be said about the French Revolution from about 1796 to the first years of the 1800's. The need for economic competition or the rewarding of the builder of the better mousetrap is essential to the evolution of technology, industry and the elimination of scarcity. The same goes for the universal availability of quality education, food, housing and health care. Another issue, I believe, in post-Maoist China is the freedom of information, speech and the declaration of political opinions in public and private. It has been some years since the clap-down of the democratic, student protests in Tiananmen Square. I remember seeing the tanks deployed on TV. This demand for representative, democratic elections and a multi-party, democratic governmental system was unsuccessful. However the seeds of freedom have been sown in China. Our information technology and the distribution of ideas will prove essential to the emergence of true democracy in China. China has come leaps and bounds in the last century. I believe they are finishing the world's largest dam (an energy-generating facility). And millions of field workers and villagers continue to move to the cities for industrial training and the hope for a better future. Another amazing accomplishment by China in recent years is the success of the Jade Rabbit. It was a lunar probe that landed on the moon and collected scientific, empirical data.\nA key step in the boosting of the social and economic power of China on the global marketplace is the establishment of contemporary, competitive factories and infrastructure. Solid infrastructure would include highways, universities, hospitals and modern housing. I am really enjoying Out of Mao's Shadow. I hope that China and North Korea explore the prospect of fair, representative democratic elections and governmental systems sooner rather than later. China has a fascinating cultural heritage that spans thousands of years. I understand that throughout China groups of people that speak vastly different dialects are able to communicate in writing via traditional Chinese characters. Considering the magnitude of the population that exists there, this is an amazing feat of literacy and information dispersion. I hope censorship ends, the free exchange of ideas increases and with it the dawn of a new age beyond the militarism of Mao."", 'That was quite a write up. I realize its an old post but.. Meanwhile our own government the ""Progressive movement"" both Democrats & establishment Republicans are deceiving ""we the people"" the voters. And systematically regressing our own country and civil society away from the Judaeo Christian God given individual rights based law of the US Constitution, into the 10 planks of communism based Marxist Socialism. Recently marketed to Bernie Sanders supporters as Democratic Socialism.\n\nObama said in 08 we are going to ""fundamentally transform America"" and the unwitting and deceived voter cheered. Our government is working to be our God. Equality is a lie that is used by government to gather the votes & support of the dis informed to gather power and control over we the people the citizens. Opportunity, freedom OF religion, a free non government controlled market or Capitalism are main reasons why people flee Socialist countries to come here. This Utopian state they paint has no choice but to become a tyrannical police state. In order to save & restore our civil society and keep our grandchildren from being controlled and lorded over by an all powerful government such as has and is happening around the world and through history. ie USSR, China, North Korea, Cuba, and most recently Venezuela. I know that can be broken down but follow the concept and look what they do to their ""citizens."" Consider these.\n\n1. Replace our politicians with Constitutional Conservatives & Conservatarians. As they actually represent us & law not Mob supported government rule. They are few in government and oppressed by establishment. The best bumper sticker I have seen is; ""Re-elect (almost) no one."" From the people we must also find more to step up and run for office. And while this needs to be done unfortunately we are past the point of this being enough to restore proper government.\n\n2. Our government has become too big sick and evil to fix itself and we cannot re-take it by the force of a war type of revolution. (although all dictatorships disarm their ""citizens."") The only legal way to take back our government is found in the US Constitution under article V. It was put their specifically by our founders for the purpose of we the people the law abiding citizens of the local communities that make up the individual states to be able to make changes to federal law where existing federal government has to adhere. It requires majority voting on proposed changes in the states and then a convention of states where 34 states agree to make a federal rule or law change. Existing federal politicians don\'t want to risk their power and control and resist by saying we could have a run a way convention. We already have a run a way government so.. An example change that is universally supported by voters is enacting term limits on politicians to get the old entrenched corrupt politicians out. You can see where they would never propose let alone allow that to be placed upon themselves. Check out www.conventionofstates.com\n\n3. We must self educate and make aware everyone we can. Most of us are largely unaware what is being done to us and would not become aware until it is too late.

187,231,Introverted sensation and its oppositions,"[""This is the section on the inferior functions (&quot;oppositions&quot;) of dominant introverted sensation from the book &quot;Jung's Compass of Psychological Types&quot; by James Graham Johnston.\n\n\n?œ[dominant] Introverted Sensation vs. [inferior] Extraverted Thinking or Feeling\nA person oriented to introverted sensation is often an artist or musician for she has a finely honed sense of the drama and beauty of perceptions. Her opposing shadow type [inferior function] could be extraverted intuition but more likely will be one of the extraverted rational functions. If extraverted thinking is the repressed type, than she will resist attention to practical problem-solving, much like the shadow type of introverted feeling. If extraverted feeling is the shadow type, then she will struggle with relating to others, much like the shadow type to introverted thinking.\n\nGeorgia O?™Keeffe, the quiet, aloof, intensive and mysterious artist, interpreting the lively impressions of nature in bold and engaging art, plays the role of aesthethic sensation ??reinterpreting accurate perceptions as enigmatic images. Normally, the shadow is opposite on the compass, but Georgia represents a crossover type. Oriented in two directions, it is often too flexible to be adequately opposed by the other crossover receptive [?˜perception?? N or S] type, extraverted intuition, played by Andrew Carnegie. The two have much in common.\n\nBecause introverted sensation and extraverted intuition sometimes appear together as lead and auxiliary pairs (Steve Jobs and Cocoa Channel are possible examples) and because they do not form the stark contrast of opposites that occur for other types, we will use the extraverted rational types represented by Darwin [extraverted thinking] and Queen Elizabeth I [extraverted feeling] for the shadow?™s opposition.^Ft.41\n\nFt.41 (Footnote 41): Empirical experience with the Gifts Compass Inventory (CGI) [author?™s own personality type test like the MBTI or Gray-Wheelwright-Winer Type Indicator] has confirmed that the shadow types for introverted sensation very often are either extraverted thinking or extraverted feeling.\n\n\nTable 7-7 Si Opposed by Te or Fe\nOrientations of\nSi: Intensive Innervations ; Te or Fe: Extensive Order or Norms\nComments on Orientation: The lead [dominant function] is intensively observant of special perceptions that ignite the archetypal embers; the shadow type wants her to be more oriented to the outward order of things.\n\nAttitudes of\nSi: Apprehend Innvervations ; Te or Fe: Perceive Order or Norms\nComments on Attitudes: The lead inwardly moves from one intensive innervation to the next, seeking to more fully grasp it; the shadow type urges her to come back to the real outer world and to grasp the order of the things there.\n\nFunctional Roles of\nSi: Aesthetic Sensation ; Te or Fe: Constructive Thinking or Social Feeling\nComments on Functional Role: The lead is content to apprehend the innervations, to break in their aesthetic thrill; the shadow type beckons her to construct some order or affirm some standard out of her perceptions.\n\nSubstances of\nSi: Inner Perceptions ; Te or Fe: Outer Thoughts or Valuations\nComments on Substance: The lead is forever at work with her inner perceptions - it is the stuff that is most real to her; the shadow type wants her to work more with the stuff of outer thought or valuations.\n\nFocuses of\nSi: Holistic Innverations; Te or Fe: Particular Order or Norms\nComments on Focus: The lead enjoys seeing her innervations holistically - she is caught up in whole enticing image derived from particular perceptions; the shadow type wants her to focus more practically on some particular order or norm derived from those perceptions.\n\n\nExtreme Introverted Sensation\nThe case of introverted sensation is unusual because it is oriented simultaneously to the inner and outer object. Functionally, it orients to the outer object of the world at large, but the introverted attitude overrides that orientation, sweeping libido to the inner object of archetypal images.\n\nThus the penchant of an extreme introverted sensation attitude, like introverted intuition, is to identify too much with the contents of the collective unconscious. The composite substance - the primary material - consists of perceptions of the outer object as they are transformed by the enlivened patina of images from the unconscious. In the extreme, the individual loses the ability to differentiate the perceived object form the object in her imagination.\n\n'. . . the subject [individual] has an illusory conception of reality, which in pathological cases goes so far that he is no longer able to distinguish between the real object and subjective perception (CW 6, paragraph 651).'\n\nThe individual becomes increasingly isolated and alienated from the world at large as the ego identity aligns with the inner object. The suppression of rational functions enable free reign in the inner life of fantastic innervations. Perceptions of the world at large can be transformed into a divine comedy.\n\n'Actually he lives in a mythological world, where men, animals, locomotives, houses, rivers, and mountains appear either as benevolent deities or as malevolent demons . . . if he remains faithful to his irrationality, and is ready to grant his sensations reality value, the objective world will appear a mere make-believe and a comedy (CW 6, paragraph 653).'\n\nThe shadow types that often arise to oppose this extreme attitude are the extraverted rational types, engendering symptoms of neurosis similar to those for other extreme attitudes. If extraverted thinking plays the role of shadow type, it engages a weakly developed thinking that deprecates everything that the introverted sensation values: 'These paintings are nothing but foolishness; no one will ever like your work.' If extraverted feeling is suppressed, the weakly developed feeling manifests as a repelling irritability - grumpy, picky, and faultfinding. 'I am fed up with the hordes of people admiring my work; they are obtuse and without refined tastes.'\n\nJung assumed that extraverted intuition would be the most suppressed type. If extraverted intuition plays the role of the shadow type, it engenders '. . . shadowy, sordid, dangerous possibilities lurking in the background' (CW 6, paragraph 654). They would generate a compulsion neurosis, producing compulsive and perverse ideas. 'The snakes may get me if I go out to the canyon tomorrow to paint.'&quot;"",

188,232,The Higgs Boson and the Higgs Field,"['The existence of the Higgs boson, a very small particle, has been researched at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. This project is an ongoing attempt to verify the idea of supersymmetry. The concept of supersymmetry states that every boson is related to a corresponding fermion and, subsequently, every fermion is related to a corresponding boson. This idea transcends or supersedes traditional symmetry within the widely recognized Standard Model of particle physics. How does the theory of supersymmetry go beyond traditional symmetry? In particle physics there are four fundamental interactions of nature. These are strong interaction, electromagnetism, gravitation and weak interaction. Weak interaction is also known as quantum flavordynamics. The weak force, or weak interaction, is defined in terms of the electro-weak theory. Weak interaction is responsible for the radioactive decay and nuclear fusion of subatomic particles. In the Standard Model of particle physics the weak interaction is caused by the release or absorption of bosons. All known fermions interact through weak interaction. A fermion can be an elementary particle like electrons or it can be a composite particle like protons. The mass of various bosons is much heavier than that of protons or neutrons. The mass of the bosons makes the weak nuclear force have a short range. It is a weak nuclear force because its field strength is consistently much less in magnitude than strong nuclear force and electromagnetism. The timeline of the Big Bang is as follows: Big Bang - Planck Epoch - Grand Unification Epoch - Electroweak Epoch - Quark Epoch - Hadron Epoch - Lepton Epoch - Photon Epoch - Dark Ages - Reionization! During the Quark Epoch (very soon after the initial Big Bang) the temperature of the universe was too great to allow quarks to bind together and form hadrons. The preceding Electroweak Epoch ended as the electroweak interaction split into the weak interaction and electromagnetism. During the Quark Epoch the universe was a dense, hot quark-gluon plasma. Mesons and baryons could not yet form from the quarks. When quarks succeeded in being confined in hadrons it would mark the dawn of the Hadron Epoch on the aforementioned timeline of the Big Bang. Therefore, during the Quark Epoch the electroweak force split into the electromagnetic and weak forces. Most fermions eventually decay by weak interaction. Examples of these decaying fermions include beta decay (where the production of deuterium and helium from hydrogen powers the sun\'s and other stars\' nuclear processes), radiocarbon dating and radioluminescence. The weak interaction out of the four fundamental interactions of nature is unique because it breaks parity-symmetry and Charge Parity symmetry. This is also referred to as CP violation. The universe consists primarily of matter instead of equal parts of matter and antimatter. If the tenets of Charge Parity symmetry were preserved immediately after the Big Bang then equal amounts of matter and antimatter should have been produced. Theoretically this would have caused cancellations...protons cancelling antiprotons, electrons cancelling positrons and neutrons cancelling antineutrons. This would have created an ocean of radiation in the universe and no matter. So what happened just after the Big Bang? Experiments indicate that the weak force\'s symmetry (such as during the Electroweak Epoch) should cause the bosons to have 0 mass. This is not the case! The weak forces bosons are very massive and short-ranging. The mass and short-range of the bosons makes material structures such as atoms and stars possible. The Higgs mechanism is a mathematical model. It explains how bosons could retain their mass despite their governing symmetry. The Higgs mechanism states that the conditions for the symmetry would be broken if a field happened to exist in all of space. Then the particles would be able to have mass. The Higgs Field: According to the Standard Model the Higgs Field exists throughout space and breaks certain symmetry laws of the electroweak interaction. This field triggers the Higgs mechanism, causing the bosons responsible for the weak force to be massive. Furthermore, this may explain why electrons and quarks have mass, too. The existence of the Higgs Field might be proven by identifying a matching particle associated with it. Detecting the Higgs bosons in their various renditions or forms would prove that the Higgs Field exists. Particle colliders, detectors and computers capable of looking for Higgs bosons have taken some decades to develop. By 2013 scientists have virtually proven that the Higgs boson exists and thus the Higgs Field permeates the known universe. Certainly, additional research is necessary. According to Rolf Dieter-Heuer, ""[The] verification of real scalar fields would be nearly as important as its role in generating mass."" Some people think the Higgs Field (a scalar field) could be the inflation responsible for the exponential expansion of the universe during the Big Bang. Speculatively, the Higgs Field has been proposed to be the energy of the vacuum. Through the successive symmetry-breakings of the Higgs Field at phase transitions the present universe\'s known forces and fields arise. Personally, I am also interested in the significance and function of black holes. A black hole can be very large or so small that it is evaporated. According to Stephen Hawking black holes do radiate some particles. Also, dark matter may be related to the reactions observed in the early Big Bang. I have read about white holes (theoretically from which new universes might emerge) and creation and annihilation operators in quantum field theories. Another interesting avenue of scientific exploration are states, including ""squeezed coherent states"" along with vacuum state, squeezed vacuum state, phase squeezed state, arbitrary squeezed state and amplitude-squeezed state. Squeezed coherent states relate to Hawking radiation...such as the radiation from black holes. Can a black hole become a white hole? I don\'t know but certainly the continued research of the Higgs Field and Higgs bosons are bound to reveal a greater knowledge for mankind of the changing fabric and properties of the universe as it ages. And the possibility of the existence of other universes in the past and future and multiple dimensions via string theory or M-theory and the S-matrix and D-brane.', '""Can a black hole become a white hole?""\n\nI\'d like to spend some more time reading this monster post of yours, but I saw this and thought I ought to answer it off the bat. Theoretically, a black hole can turn into a white hole if you change either it\'s charge or angular momentum sufficiently, creating what\'s called a ""naked singularity"".\n\nThere\'s a magic equality that goes as such:\n\nQ^2 + (J / M)^2 < M^2\n\nIf you increase J or Q and falsify the inequality, what remains is the white hole you seek.\nHope that piques some interest!', 'http://www.raybans-outlet.cc/, http://www.ray-bans.net.co/, http://www.swarovski-canada.ca/, http://www.coach-factoryoutlet.net.co/, http://www.bottegaoutlet.com/, http://www.reebok-shoes.co.uk/, http://www.oakleys-online.com.co/, http://www.adidassuper-star.com.de/, http://www.michaelkorsviponline.com/, http://www.lacosteoutlet.com.co/, http://www.uggsboots.com.de/, http://www.pandora-jewellery.com.es/, http://www.oakleys.com.de/, http://www.ralphlaurens-outlet.net/, http://lions.nfl-jerseys.org/, http://rockets.nbajerseysvip.com/, http://www.nikeshoes.fr/, http://www.nikefreerun-inc.co.uk/, http://www.thomas-sabos.com.de/, http://www.mcm-backpacks.com.co/, http://www.guessfactorys.com/, http://www.raybanvip.com/, http://raptors.nbajerseysvip.com/, http://www.outlet-toryburchshoes.com/, http://www.thomas-sabo.us.com/, http://www.nike-free-runs.de/, http://www.hermesbagsoutlet.com/, http://www.michael-korsbags.com.co/, http://www.jeans-truereligion.com/, http://www.adidas-shoes.com.co/, http://www.converses.us.com/, http://www.longchamp-bagsoutlet.com/, http://www.nike-store.com.de/, http://eagles.nfl-jerseys.org/, http://www.adidasschuhe-online.com.de/, http://www.newiphone-cases.com/, http://www.nikefree5.com.co/, http://hawks.nbajerseysvip.com/, http://www.danskos-shoes.com/']","['Science & Technology', 'General Topics']",General Topics

192,238,Which MBTI type is most likely....,"[""Don't take these so seriously.\n\nJust because there are many of a certain type that has this trait, that does not mean that all of them have that trait.\n\nOk, here we go.\n\nWhich MBTI is most likely to...\n\nBe president/prime minister?\n\nBe atheist?\n\nBe religious?\n\nBe in the army?\n\nBe a doctor?\n\nBe promiscuous?\n\nBe prejudiced?\n\nBe emotionally distant?\n\nBe excessively emotional?\n\nBe wise?\n\nBe shy?\n\nBe a bit simple-minded?\n\n\n\nOnce again, this is not supposed to be taken very seriously.\n"", 'If we use STEREOTYPES and SOME TRENDS, this is what I have observed (taking in famous individuals at least)\n\nSo the problem right off the bat is, is that the sample size is small, its debatable as to what the personality type for some of these individuals are, and sometimes its inappropriate to make casual infrences from anecdotal non-random correlations.\n\nBut I enjoy this, so its for teh LULZ:\n\npresident/prime minster:\nMy first pick would probably be ENTJ. These people always think in terms about how to maximize everything possible in the applicable world. They also are known as the most natural-leaders out of all the mbti. They best characterize by planning everything out. A lot of their lives I noticed are constant planning, and that thrills them. They tend to be extremely socially adept and very convincing people.\nFamous examples: Stalin, Napoleon, Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Julius Caesar, Karl Rove, Dick Cheney\nENFJ can also be attributed here.\nBut in general, there have been presidents of almost every mbti if I do believe.\n\nAthiest:\nINTP/ENTP tend to be some of the types that least likely believe in a diety. These guys form logical premise\' and attempt to draw universal conclusions from the data and information that\'s presented to them. Quite a bit of these guys tend to be logicians, analysists, and philosophers who set a logical framework in approaching questions.\nExamples: Socrates, John Stuart Mill, Voltaire, David Hume, Richard Dawkin, Descartes\nalso most of the more controversial/liberal/comedy reporters tend to be ENTP and often make fun of religion: Stephent Colbert, John Stuart, Bill Maher\n\nReligious:\nINFJ & quite a lot of xSxJs as well\nINFJs tend to be very spiritual and are known as the one of the deepest feelers in the mbti. Thus they find religion as solace and as an outlet for themselves and their religion. They are also visionary in the way they want to change the world. So if the religion that they are in encompasses their view and understanding of the world, that will fuel them even more. INFJs also tend to put religion and immediate family into their closest values most of the time, but ofcourse not for every INFJ.\nexamples: Jesus, Hitler\nxSxJs tend to follow discipline and want to fit in with an order in society. There\'s of course many that don\'t follow this or don\'t want to, but generally most do. Many of them are part of their religions because its the ""right"" thing in their community, and they want to serve that function.\n\nbe in the army:\nESTJ along with certain xSxP (ommitting ISFP and most likely ISTP, but possibility none-the-less)\nESTJ are very well at following direct orders and achieving them when it comes to a very practical down to earth setting. Quite a bit of ESTJs have the nickname of ""Drill Sargent"" Not only that but they excel at it. Most of these individuals get high up in army ranking and management, if the regime of the army works for them.\nCertain xSxPs are also likely to join, simply to find what they are looking for in life, to learn a form of order, they think its exciting, boredom, etc. These types can either progress or digress as any person tentatively could, but they are most likely to join for the above reasons.\n\nBecome a doctor:\nIf we are referring to doctor in the medical profession, hmmmm I would be inclined to think every type has an equal chance, simply because the profession entails something of interest for everyone: helping people, achieving a high goal in society, money, respect, etc. etc. But I would be inclined to think xSxJ and xSxP types have a *slightly* higher chance, since they tend to be more proficient at memorizing countless of details whereas xNxJ and xNxP types tend to be greater at learning concepts and ideas quicker. A lot of medical study is memorization based more than actual concept/idea (at least on initiation).\n\nPromiscous:\nESFP and some ESTP as well. They tend to be very light hearted individuals who just want to have their share of what they deem fun.\nThe ESFP especially tends to be one of the types that utilizes their body well and if wanted to, can excel at manipulation.\nEven though people can give them the label as promiscuous, in their eyes, they look to it as enjoying life and making the most out of every day.\n\nPrejudiced:\nSORRY GUISE, but I would probably again say xSxJ and xSxP. Many of these individuals, tend to label and think things through with what they deem ""object-able"" criteria, without allowing other peoples interjections or possibilities as options. They will typically tend to be stubborn in this regard and stick with what they view as traditional and appropriate, even if there are logically and reasonably better alternatives.\n\nemotionally distant:\nINTP, certain INTJ, hurt INFP and INFJ.\nINTP individuals tend to have schizoid and schizoid-typal personality traits, where they appear distant, non-expressive, and non-emotional. Eventhough ofcourse they have their own deep and personal experiences. That\'s how many of them carry it. As well as all the INxx personalities I put here, tend to have avoidant personality traits, where almost all/most of these types hate conflict. Emotion and representation of emotion can be viewed as a conflict by these types, so they can appear non-expressive.\n\nexcessively emotional:\nxNFP and some xSFPs in general, usually extroverted. Most of these individuals have Fe, where they have to project how they feel and their emotions to other people. That\'s how they deal with most of their emotions rather than holding it in (Fi) like xNFJ and xSFJs. The people deemed excessively emotional tend to have dependent personality traits among other traits and potentially disorders.\n\nWise:\nthis is very broad and can be interpreted SOOOOOOO many different ways. Well in generalized tradition, let\'s look at it this way:\nxNTx tend to be extremely analytical and have extroverted approaches to dealing with logic and reasoning. Tend to be quite philosophical and mentally potent.\nxNFx tend to be more experience and idea associated with people and humanity. Many tend to be philosophical, but attempt to concentrate on greater ideas constantly.\nxSxP tend to appreciate asthetic beauty, and find ways to enjoy life, even when they see obstacles in their way. They simplify difficulties rather than scrutinize them, and that is wisdom as well.\nxSxJ tend to realize structures of society, and how they can get by and maximize on it faster than other mbti temparments. Tend to get ahead, be very down to earth, and practical.\nIf we use the system of IQs (But IQ should not be used as a scale for representation and wisdom. Its more so a scale of how logical and analytic a person is with problem-solving), most of the mbti follow this trend:(highest IQs on avg.) INTJ, INTP, INFJ, INFP, ENTJ, ENTP, ENFJ, ENFP, ISTJ, ISTP, ISFJ, ISFP, ESTJ, ESTP, ESFJ, ESFP (lowest)\n\nBe shy:\nISFP, INFP, INFJ and to a lesser degree INTx and ISTx\nMost of these guys create inner worlds where they live their life in their heads. Sometimes the transition between thought and expression is difficult for these individuals, and they cannot necessarily express themselves with words at time, or find ways to describe their emotions adequately. Most people find these individuals aloof. These guys also tend to sometimes feel that communication can be conflicting in scenarios, thus giving the appearance of a shy person.\n\nSimple-minded:\nESFP/ESTP sometimes along with ISFJ/ESFJ. The latter tend to be very practical, and for the most part down to earth people who focus on concerns pertaining to them or what they set up as a fundamental structure of perceiving the world. The prior is similar in this regard, but they focus on their enjoyment of utilizing life, rather than following a fundamental structure. This makes some of them often seem simple-minded or YOLO LULZ individuals.\n\n', 'I failzzz I took it to seriously :p haha',

I wouldn't change havign shared my body with people i have, i have loved learned had fun and some of it has been so incredible, it really fills a part of me that needs to connect deeply with people, not just any people, but not just relationships.\n"", ""I don't really feel like premartial sex is something not done... But yes, in my country Belgium, only really weird people would wait with sex till marriage. Cause in our society nowadays, it's something you should have done because everyone is talking about it...\n\nI lost my virginity to someone I wasn't even in love with, so yes I do regret it... but mostly because it was some stupid vegeance against my ex, like, hahah, you see, I'm having another one and I'm so totally over you... :(\n\nSex is a part of live, and well, I'm not the one to wait for very long, because next to that one guy, I'm totally ready to jump the other one. If someone looks very hot, I'm not very good in waiting... I'm impatient.\n\nBut, out of experience, sex should only be done with someone important to you. It may be your spouse, it may be your boyfriend, it may be someone who can help you feel better about yourself. And okay, I had a one-nightstand, turned it into a two-night stand, but that was me being very adventurous on a trip. I totally felt awesome after that. Because it was a guy from a total different continent, so I was very proud. The most daring story of my life xd\n\nAnd if you practise, you can find out what you like.... so it's easier than for finding the right one, I suppose? And also, some things... I mean, it's nice to try it out with someone, and then be able to run for the hills. :) But, when I will find that special guy, I'll probably cry my eyes out because it's so amazing and so special. You can't truelly understand the beauty of Rome, if you haven't visit other places to compare it with, I'm guesing?"", ""I think premarital sex if fine as long as both people are honestly ready and consenting.\n\nPersonally, I'd only consider sex if I was in a serious relationship. I need to have a soul and mind connection before getting so physical. There are other ways to physically express your sexuality until you're sure you want to have sex.\n"", ""For myself as an INFJ, and my sexual preferences, I have to feel extremely close to that person or else sex is something I'm not interested in from them. How do I say this... If I am not connected on a mental level with that person, then physical aspect of a relationship are repelling to me. I have to feel a bond with them before I could ever have sex with them. I've been all over from friends with benefits to serious, long, relationships, and it doesn't matter. If I don't feel close to them, sex is disgusting to me. Just having sex though does not make you a slut, and it's not something to be embarrassed about to me. If you genuinely want to wait until you're married or in a very committed relationship though, that is your decision, and as long as you are proud of your own decision based on your own beliefs, then it's a good thing. If it's just beliefs someone has pushed on to you, I hope it's not going to keep you back from something you genuinely want."", ""Bennie133, I've never know anyone but myself to feel that way about the idea of sex/physical contact form someone I'm not connected with. I've had my niceness misread and taken as an invitation. It disgusts me when that happens and I have a hard time getting over it, but that kind of stuff seems to just roll off some people."", ""AnnaMomiji, I know exactly what you mean! I've also have been in a situation where niceties have been misread, and it just leaves me feeling so uncomfortable and grossed out, that I have to find a way to leave. It's hard to deal with, especially when most people do not understand why it bothers you so much."", ""I also choose to be married before having sex. I personally do not feel I can genuinely give as much of myself otherwise. I'm divorced, so I've been there. I enjoy it so much more with deep commitment. I also have to be mentally and emotionally connected to go there. I am also highly sexual but I choose to only share that with one man that I'm married to at a time. I just hold back too much without the sense of sexual security marriage brings."", 'I agree with this 100%. n_n It is a beautiful thing to consider.', 'I kinda have the same plan. I honestly struggle with intimacy because while I do definitely feel attraction and crave it, I have to know someone pretty well to act on it. sometimes I just want to get rid of my virginity but dating is hard because I really have to be interested enough to get to know someone really well before going beyond platonic and by then, we just end up being friends. For a while I though I was ace or demi but I still experience the sexual attraction beforehand??',

195,241,Short Stories,"['Here\'s an idea! Let\'s see if short stories can fit into this web-site. I suppose we can use more than one ""frame"" if necessary.', ""KIN\n\nLava flowed over the surface of Proto-Earth. The sea roiled and crested in massive proportions as it surged against the black, volcanic crags of what would be Pangaea.\nMollusk-kin thrived in the heated waters. The sentient, behemoth beings hunted in the depths. They took care to avoid the deadly, glowing heat of the lava, which cracked and sizzled as it shifted along the ocean floor.\nI am concerned for the future of our young, intoned T'seil, a female mollusk-kin.\nShe addressed her mate, Chugon.\nThe sea surges more violently than it has in the memory of the Kin. I fear that our offspring will not find adequate hunting waters or be able to navigate by the light of the stars in the nighttime sky.\nThe Kin lived in symbiosis with great forests of kelp. Algae and kelp formed in swirling, cooling pools within the near-steaming currents of the planetary ocean of Proto-Earth. The Kin fed on tiny crustaceans, called krill, which in turn fed on the surrounding, submarine forests. The Kin kept the kelp parasite-free and healthy.\nThis was the known way of life of the Kin before the source of T'seil's concern.\nMassive storm clouds now formed on the surface of the heated seas. Strange lightning struck the waves repeatedly. Other gatherings of Kin had reported losses of members of their hunting and foraging groups to the lethal, electric bolts. The turbulent weather additionally made it impossible to follow the planet's rotation and guide their travels to fresh kelp pools by starlight.\nT'seil and Chugon led their offspring with other Kin in their tribe. It was time to move on. The kelp forests awaited them beyond the heated currents.\nThe storm clouds coalesce like never before, T'seil, intoned Chugon. We must bring our young to safe water before the lightning strikes.\nI agree, loved-one, T'seil answered.We must hurry.\nThe pair of Kin did what they could to hasten their family along while the clouds seemed to darken and glower with malevolence. Silver and blue bolts of electricity struck the surface of the ocean and thunder boomed in resonating waves across the horizon.\nStrange orbs fell from the centers of the clouds to pierce the water and dive deep. Each of the metallic spheres was twice the size of Chugon, who measured 60 meters from tentacles to head.\nInteresting, hummed the male Kin. Keep the young moving, T'seil. I will dive to investigate one of these strange objects more closely.\nAs Chugon drew near to the orb it changed. Mechanical vibrations emanated from the surface of the foreign sphere. Chugon extended a tentacle to probe the device as it continued to drop into the depths. The male mollusk-kin was startled to sense a static charge from the strange object. Rows of lights aligned in spirals along the circumference sparkled as the orb gave the appearance of coming to life.\nA voice bellowed in the water speaking, surprisingly, in a dialect that Chugon understood.\nWe are the Xoids. This is a fluorishing environment. Our collective has chosen to claim it for the Process. You are a superb specimen. It is clear that this planet has potential.\nChugon sensed magnetic force pulling him toward the sizable, electric orb. The energy was much the same as that of gravity which the Kin knew grew stronger when he dove deeper into the sea. He tried to maneuver away from the alien artifact to no avail. It was intent on capturing the scion of the depths.\nThe Xoid, as it called itself split at the center and each half rotated in opposite directions. Within the opening at it's center was a restraining net which glowed green in the fading-light of the dense water. The ethereal net expanded and surrounded Chugon like a bubble. There was enough water for him to respirate but the restrictive tethers gave him virtually no freedom of movement.\nAlas, I fear for the safety of T'seil and our offspring. I wonder what will become of them in the wake of this alien invasion.\nThe halves of the Xoid rotated back to their original positions and closed in upon the captured Kin. The lights and internal vibrations of the cybernetic entity intensified. The living machine stopped its descent into the darkness and rose toward the surface at an accelerating rate.\nT'seil and many of the other Kin of their hunting and foraging tribe were startled by potent spumes of water as the Xoids and their captured cargo zoomed toward the upper atmosphere of Proto-Earth and beyond.\nThe motherships await, hummed a disembodied voice.\nChugon and others of his captured kindred moaned in dread.\nThe Kin traveled beyond space and time. The Xoids were aggressive. They insisted on testing the faculties of survival of the aquatic mollusks. Chugon and his companions were resilient, however, and they endured despite their discomfort. None of the imprisoned Kin had knowledge of the time or location of the hostile motherships. Unbeknownst to them millennia passed on Proto-Earth and other species evolved to sentience.\nIt was then that the Xoid ships and their dismal menagerie encountered one of their many nemesi, acquired over epochs of intergalactic exploitation and abuse. They were the Galdur, a race of explorers whose territorial contention with the Xoids was bitter and ancient.\nAn image appeared before Chugon, drawing him from his troubled stasis.\nWhat is this, another test? wondered the melancholic Kin?¦\nOur enemies are near. We must purge our cargo. You will be placed in the seas below. Time has passed and the water has cooled. It will prove sufficient for your needs. Beware of the Galdur for they are hostile to we Xoids and will pursue us. There is little time to dally here. Farewell, mollusk-kin.\nA gate opened in the hull of the ship below Chugon and he was summarily dropped nearly 10 meters to the cool ocean of Future-Earth. The water was cold and it took Chugon several moments to become acclimated to the temperature change.\nThis place is strange. It is at once like the seas before my abduction yet darker and more ancient, thought the giant mollusk-kin.\nThe denizen of the ocean detected the presence of a variety of marine life he had not previously encountered. These included giant, aquatic mammals with mighty, paddle-shaped flippers and muscular tails.\nThe warm-blooded carnivores hunted and foraged in pods and Chugon dove in a defensive maneuver, hoping to avoid detection. The mammals' faculties of echolocation were strong, however, and they sent a handful of their number to pursue him as he dove.\nChugon was frightened and emitted a cloud of black ink with the marginal hope that it would confuse the focused predators. The diversion proved ineffective as the mammals no longer depended on visible light to orient themselves in the deep.\nThe water grew cold and pressurized as Chugon continued to dive, funneling water through the respiratory spout at the base of his head. The carnivores drew close, tracking the kin with echolocated bursts. Chugon accelerated in a desperate attempt to avoid an attack. He was not fast enough, though, and a mammal snapped at his rear tentacles, taking a small piece of tissue in its powerful jaws.\nA voice permeated the depths and a light shone down from above. Chugon shied away in apprehension, thinking the Xoids had returned.\nWe are the Galdur. The Xoid ships have escaped us once again. You do not belong here. We will transport you to your proper place and time. Come with us, now.\nA strong tractor beam clutched the frightened mollusk-kin from above and raised him quickly through the dark water toward the surface. The hungry mammals were confounded at the strange change in course of their prey and returned to surface at a slower rate. They would hunt again and surely catch their quarries as they often did.\nChugon was taken aboard the Galdur ship along with the other creatures of Proto-Earth that had been haphazardly dumped into the dark seas of the future. They were carried with a large supply of sea water so they could respirate easily.\nThe Galdur used the gravitational pull of the Earth's sun to fling their massive ship at super-light speed through the solar system. By the time they neared the Earth it was several million years before the age of the aquatic mammals. The mollusk-kin thrived in the salty, heated waters. What continents there were smoked and sizzled with volcanic youth.\nConcerned for the welfare of their living cargo, the Galdur brought their boons as close to the point of their abduction as was feasible.\nFarewell, Earthlings, a kind voice intoned. You are home. We will remain watchful for the Xoids may return, although it is not likely that they will do so in your lifetimes.\nChugon and the other captives were released into the ocean of their origin. They went their separate ways.\nIt was only a matter of time before Chugon found his fellow mollusk-kin and T'seil, who brought their young close to their father. They returned to their natural foraging pattern and vowed never to become separated again."", 'I mostly write narratives, dialog is not my strong point.', ""I'm vary strong on dialogue and action, not

Use your own introspection and thinking process when analyzing these questions...', 'Let me give you a few things that spring to mind:\n- Racist\n- contradictions\n- and hypocrites\n\nThey just serve as my buddies to commit crime with. I have a 12 year friendship with an ISFJ and hes pretty much worthless for everything apart from to play tricks on people and to train muay thai with.\nI heard a similar thing from a female ENFP friend. Anyway this is one perspective - my sample is 1 and my credibility is non-existent in this instance.\n', ""I have two ISFJ friends. I like being with them although they are not very talkative which is maybe a good thing bc it makes me talk more :) I love how they can put others before them but honestly.. it is very easy to 'guide' them. They are also very reliable and stand behind their principles and I respect them for that.""]","['Rationals', 'Personality', 'INTJ - Mastermind']",INTJ - Mastermind

202,248,Things you wish you could forget,"['I don\'t know if this is true about all INTP\'s, but I have a rock solid memory that goes as far back as being a toddler, maybe further than that. I remember what my crib looks like, diapers, crawling, and the taste of baby formula. I think I should be glad that I was bottle fed, not to sound sexist however if I were breast fed there would probably be a very good chance I\'d remember that too.\n\nFor this memory it haunts me that every time I come across something that I have tried then failed or having to stand in front of others to speak out to a crowd no matter how small, this memory reveals itself at inopportune times. This was kindergarten 1985-1986, the class was set to do a school play, it was a very simple one we would all get an animal and say a cute little line then walk off stage. My animal was a lamb/sheep and my line was simply ""baaa I\'m a little lamb"" that\'s easy enough right? Not so much as I figured out, when I walked out on stage the first thing that caught my attention is all the people in the auditorium from the front row all the way to the back wall filled with children, adults, and cameras.\n\nAt this point I freaked out and froze up in fear just staring at all those faces, the teacher gently pulled me to the side and read me my line again then pushed me back out. I repeated what I did earlier and froze up, I knew my line but for the life of me could not blurt it out with all those people staring, waiting for me to say this stupid line. My teacher finally got fed up, with a jerk pulling at my arm she mutters under her breath ""you\'re hopeless"" pulling me off stage and apologizing to the crowd that the little lamb was unable to perform. Anytime from that point on all grades if I ever had to get up in front of the class to do a report or whatever, I just freeze up with those words coming back to me ""you\'re hopeless"" ringing in my head.\n\nIt felt like a self-fulfilling prophecy, or maybe she was right about me long before I knew it. I think this is when my self-loathing started, but I\'m not exactly sure though it might have been earlier than that. In any case I have never been able to shake this memory, it\'s always there and resurfaces whenever I attempt anything that requires social interaction. I\'m not looking for sympathy posting this, I just want to know how to forget, the hardest thing to do in my life is forgetting. I can\'t simply put it out of my mind because it floods back to me like a video recording playback. The names, the voices, the faces, and that stupid costume I was wearing; all of it comes back fresh as the day it happened.', ""There's a long-lasting staffing struggle in American schools between the SJ majority and the NT, NF, SP minority. It's very political and I won't get into it here but being conscious of the differences in social processing of the different temperaments has helped me interpret the past, and prepare for the future."", 'You need to master this art: It will help you coup!\n\nhttp://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck', ""INTPs are known for their ability to rehash the bad things that happened to them with fine, torturous precision. For us, we use all the data we have at hand to come to conclusions and probable outcomes. That includes personal experience, especially the bad ones as the often will represent the 'worst case scenario'.\n\nThese bad experiences will often reinforce our introversion as a 'see, you put yourself in a position and a bad thing happened. Don't put yourself in those poistions again because bad things can happen.'"", 'This may or may not be helpful since I am posting 2 years after the original comment but I thought it might be helpful to someone who read this thread with a similar problem. My two pieces of advice/ideas would be to check into EFT or Emotional Freedom Technique also called ""tapping."" Check out the book, The Tapping Solution. It is supposed to be great for working out fears, emotional setbacks, mental blocks.\nSecondly, consider seeing a hypnotist. Seriously.\nIt sounds hooky and a bit ""out there"" but people have overcome much worse fears and setbacks through hypnotism and EFT than stage fright. If it is hindering you for progressing in your career and relationships then I definitely think the money and time spent on it would be worth it. Just my thoughts. I don\'t have experience using hypnotism at all and I have only used EFT in a limited manner but many people swear it works for them. Hope you find something worthwhile to help conquer your fears.\nAnother point, what that teacher or ""educator"" said to you about ""being hopeless"" should have never been said. What a terrible thing to say to anyone but especially a young, impressionable child. It simply was uncalled for. You are living out her or his false negative belief because you believed it was true even though in reality it didn\'t have to be. The false belief programmed your thinking and now you believe you are ""hopeless"" at public speaking or presentation because you were said to be. This is the same as the placebo effect on people but in reverse. Also called the ""nocebo effect."" If you want to learn more about how false limiting beliefs are formed check out: Mind Over Medicine by Dr. Lissa Rankin and also The Biology of Belief by Dr. Bruce Lipton.\nBoth excellent places to start in your journey toward confidence and gaining new skills.']","['Rationals', 'INTP - Architect', 'Personality']",INTP - Architect

Granted, one\'s interests must also be factored into satisfaction in a job or line of work. However, I have read that INFJ\'s tend to be happiest in careers related to counseling others (hence ""counselor""), the arts, or in the medical field.\n\nPersonally, I work in public accounting as an auditor. This line of work has been challenging, especially in the first few years, given the requirement to be so focused on details for long periods of time. I get excited about new/fresh ideas and creating. I\'ve had more opportunities for this as I move up in my Company, but largely they are limited.\n\nWhat careers/jobs are you INFJ\'s in and how satisfied are you?', ""Well, I'm in-between jobs right now but just finished a stint as an office worker for nearly a year. I really liked the job and feel it represents a worthy avenue of exploration. I have an Associate's Degree in History and Political Science and still intend to return for a BA in English Literature with an emphasis in Creative Writing, then Law School. Part of the job development program affiliated with my past job possesses a team of staff continuing to assist me in finding an appropriate capacity, namely office work. I am an INFJ and am sure that even when I do finish law school I will always write novels and articles of fiction and non-fiction.

Now, wouldn't that be a much better system than what we have in place now? Anyway, auditing sounds like it would be awfully boring. :/ Once I've gotten college out of the way, I hope to get into filmmaking.

I have been having this conversation about career with myself for quite some time. For about two years now I have been a personal trainer in the health and fitness industry. I enjoy the work very much and find it satisfying to engage with clients one-on-one on a personal level. You get to learn all sorts of things about them and vice versa. Because you see them at a frequency of 2-3x/ week for an hour over a period of 2-3 months or more it is very easy for clients to feel like really good friends.

I hated the technical side of it but loved the creative. I always gravitated into a management position which was also a mixed bag. I was very good with people but disappointed they could not live up to my expectations. Then I rehabbed houses a couple years before becoming an appraiser. I loved the learning but like all things I get in to, I quickly became bored. I almost feel as though I've painted myself in a corner. I've done a pretty good job of automating a lot of the details. Now that appraisers are mostly anonymous, I hardly talk to anyone and only work about 25 hrs a week. The introvert in me has painted himself in a corner. I'm like the dog that caught the car."", 'I been working as a professional nurse in a large hospital for five years. Initially, I was very much confused on what to take as a course in college. All I know is that my strength is leaning more on science. I have also consider being a medical doctor, but it takes too long to be one. Basically, I end up as nurse and taking my masters degree. In someway it is rewarding when patients look up to you with appreciation but other times due to the stressful environment and facing conflict with different people, it just feels draining.', 'Wow Leperkin, you dove right into my mind with your way of thinking. Thanks for that!', 'Meditate and you will find the best fruits!', 'I think we INFJs struggle a lot with this question, about what career to choose- we tend to be perfectionistic, and want to find the ""right"" career that will lead us to fulfill our ultimate potential. Though, I\'m not sure that my experience was like other\'s; I was a pretty weird kid: I was pretty good at math/science and the writing/humanities/social sciences. That probably had something to do with my indecisiveness on a career path. It has taken me a long time to figure out that my first passion was always the one I\'d end up picking. Since I was in kindergarten and elementary school, I was always happy to help others learn (according to my parents) and was pretty good at it, even though I could be a bit sassy lol I once told my teacher, who asked me to help another student with their homework ""Why are you making me do your job?"" LOL! I would go through lots of passions until I got to grad school, including marine biology, architecture/design, math, writing, counseling, paleontology, botany, environmental sciences, history, social justice issues, business, economics, politics, policy, and international relations. Then, once I actually got to teach students in college I realized I wanted to do this indefinitely. Lucky for me, I landed a teaching job and currently teach in higher education. I honestly really love my job. It\'s stressful for sure, and I act as a mentor and counselor on top of being a teacher, since students deal with many issues besides their coursework, but I know it\'s what I\'ve always wanted to do. If I were to give some advice for other INFJs it\'s to continue exploring your options. Don\'t be afraid to take your time to find an area that makes you feel fulfilled and that meets your needs. I know it\'s hard to accept because we don\'t like ambiguity, for things to be out of our control or to not know what awaits us (I still hate feeling that way), but we\'ll find our way through the fog. We\'re pretty good at that.', 'I have been a hairstylist for 13 years. I haven?™t ever done anything else. Personally I?™ve always wanted to be some sort of a counselor or to do something that helps people. I love my job because i can be creative, but also help out someone. I?™m cheaper than a therapist. Lol!', ""I have worked in the accounting field, desktop publishing, customer service, and now I work in Municipal Government. I think I'm happiest in my current field, I still get to do some accounting, I get to flex my creative muscles with working on the City newsletter, website, and flyers, I get to help people and make my community better which always makes me happy, I have a pretty good balance of time alone in my office crunching numbers or researching and time up front interacting with the public, all in all it's a pretty great fit for me. My dream job would be to be a writer, but I need more personal discipline before I can do that for income.""]","['Romantics ', 'Personality', 'INFJ - Counselor']",INFJ - Counselor

NEET (no education, employment, or training)?\n\nOfcourse I'm sure that a person of any mbti could become one of these due to any circumstance. But what are your opinions?"", ""Introverts can last longer in a solitary situation without cracking. I'd say that E's are more likely to be motivated to go to work/school if only for the social benefits. Aside from that, I'm not really sure. Looking at the people I know that have been in this situation, they were mostly IXFP."", ""Nah. I'm good."", '^Lol. You see why we have NEETS in the first place? Because politicians like Ronald Reagan (ESFP) are allowed to govern. In reality, only INTP and INTJ should be allowed anywhere near political power.', ""Excuse you, just because I personally am not a political figure, doesn't make any other ESFP the same!"", 'Haha, at INTP troll.^ Although, I agree with a slight modification... only INTJs should have political power. :D (Kidding)\n\nTo answer the question, most definitely ISFP. Most ESFPs seem to keep their life ""rolling"" as one of my ESPF friends puts it. I\'ve known two ISFPs who went into and out of homelessness. There was deep depression and substance abuse involved.', ""lol @ that kind of political power... surprising that there are even INT*s who aren't anarchists... (of course leaving room for free-association/voluntary intraspecies hierarchy such as an inexperienced person requesting the aid of an experienced person)\n\nin regards to the original question, I would agree that introverts are probably as specific as you can get in determining who is more likely to end up in such a situation. I know that I myself, as an INTP/ISTP/INTJ, could very easily end up being homeless as I already am unemployed and intend to remain that way as long as I exist."",

206,252,INFP + ISFP = ???,"[""Hey, for a while I've been currently seeing an ISFP woman. We are good friends who've known each other for a few years but fell out of touch for a while due to pursuing different life goals, and now are connecting and spending quite a lot of time together.\nTypically I notice in our friendship, I am the relative extrovert and the person who plans and organizes general activities. I see that she loves to partake in activities rather than in conversation; we go to different nature sites often, go to a new bookstore and read together, ice skate, I play a song and she sings, etc. We genuinely enjoy each other's company and have same values for what we want out of life.\nWe both enjoy each other and express interest in a romantic relationship, and she's waiting for me to initiate.\nBut I feel that when it comes to conversation, we don't really connect. With my close friends I'm used to having extremely in-depth conversations about interests, theories, hobbies, etc. that have created and bonded our friendship. Whereas when I talk to her, its usually a conversation about what looks cute/pretty, tactile sensations, concrete experiences, and how we feel about things in general. I understand that it is not small talk, and that what she talks about definitely is personal. But I just see it as a bit above small talk. She's much more activity oriented whereas I am theory oriented.\nIts funny it feels like we are almost the same person except we speak completely different languages. We have very similar perception and experience, but talk about it in completely different terms. I see that she doesn't understand a lot of what I say, so I adapt to her.\nI typically keep my self intellectually occupied all the time, whether I am alone or with friends. But I see that I would not get intellectual enjoyment with her.\n\nWhat thoughts do you guys have about my scenario or the idea of an INFP+ISFP romantic relationship?\n"", ""Oh yes I forgot to mention, she has Asperger's as well. I recognize the basic characteristics of it, but it has not gotten in the way at all. In fact it encourages me to be more direct and communicative with her, and for her to be more responsive as well."", ""Not sure if this will help much, but I do have some insight on the N/S divide that is the source of all communication issues between sensors and intuitives.\n\nI dated an INTJ once, and we lasted a year. I'm ISTP and have enough of my tertiary and inferior functions developed to where I can understand others' emotions well enough, despite not actually being a feeler. However, much like you and your ISFP had communication issues, I had the same problem with the INTJ. Of course, both of us being introverted as well as thinkers, we understood one another on a basic level. It was when communication and adaptation/routine (aka J/P) came into play that we had issues. So, obviously, it didn't work out.\n\n\n\nNow, you seem to know exactly what the issue is, and that's a great step! The fact that you are patient with your romantic interest despite her condition is admirable, as that is not something many can deal with. Though, because your ISFP is a sensor and you are not, there is going to have to be some compromise between you both if you really want this to work. You both have things that you could learn from one another, so why not try being more open to her sense of the world so that she could try and be open to yours? Just an idea. Might be worth a shot.\n\nBest of luck!"", ""Hello. I'm an isfp.Isfp's can have intellectual conversations but we typically delay them, it's very difficult for us to articulate intellectual thoughts into words, she will probably take a long time before she feels comfortable with it, a lot of the time if we are still slightly uncomfortable we can open our mouths to say one thing and something completely different comes out, it's frustrating for her too, I'm sure there are plenty of things she wishes she could share with you but just isn't sure how to say it yet.

MBTI consists of 8 distinct cognitive types, which combine in the functional stack to take into account a range of different personality types. This results in 16 different types, which not only increases the amount of different types of people that are represented, but also the depth to which each type can be detailed. MBTI also has other details/rules such as the dominant and inferior functions are opposites and in a tug of war, and the dominant and Auxiliary being opposite, in terms of their introversion/extroversion and judging/perception.

210,256,Is INFP the hardest type to be for us worthless males?,"['From my anecdotal daily observations of SOSiety, I see that women are often portrayed and valued as a piece of flesh that is desired and that men are only valued for their slave wage contributions as well at times as a meat chariot among other aesthetics.\n\nFrom observing various people I notice that typically INFP and INFJ individuals have difficulty conforming to American societies\' general values as well a decent amount of ISFP. But a lot of males in NF types generally, seem to be panned down by what society expects of them.\n\nINFP males tend to be characterized by ""deemed"" feminine attributes. These characteristics are accepted when females show them to other individuals\', but are shunned and ridiculed when they are attributed to a male. Personally I am content with my state and these problems don\'t affect me, but I can\'t help but notice and think that it affects others.\n\nWhat are your guys\' thoughts about this?\n\n', ""I don't know about INFP since it's quite different from INFJ when you think about it, but as an archetypal INFJ I can relate to your observation. It's pretty hard for me to cope with a society portraying a kind of men that I'll never be and that I'll never want to be. I don't have to be successful to be proud of myself; I don't even have to be proud of myself to live happily. I make everyone laugh when I say that I actually don't want to win at something if it means someone's going to lose. For a long time before my discovery of MBTI, I thought I was crazy... now, I know that we're many ;-) But that's OK. Not the easiest with women (why am I here, you ask? ;-) but I even started to think that's OK too. Yes, I'm fleeing for sure, even a little, but as hard as I try to live in and cope with a world I fully understand, I don't have the will to pretend. I never have. Here I am, a broken, alone, clueless, confused, fragile, bitter, never good enough, rejected and crushed INFJ, among other things... but strangely fine. Here lies beauty."", ""I sadly think that according to social stereotypes INFPs or even ISFPs males are often mistaken for effeminate (not to say gay). But it's somewhat the same for INTJ and ENTJs girl, who act way in a too masculine way, according to the same worthless stereotypes."", ""Not at all - most INFP males I've met, including one with whom I was with for many years - have their quiet allure, depth and are generally well-loved by all. I think they just have to have far less doubt of themselves sometimes. And those who recognise their typology and values, without feeling that they should be different or more mainstream, can be quite confident. INFP males are very special, and make excellent, loyal friends and deep, faithful soulmates."", ""As an INFP male I only found it difficult when I didn't fully accept/understand myself at a younger age. As I grew and matured and hung around more of societies version of men, I quickly realized I was different and trying to live up to the status quo was stressful. When I learned more about myself and accepted these differences life simply changed for me.\n\nI began to realize that people for whatever reason seemed to really like me especially when it came to dating. At least from what I noticed as an INFP male I'm quiet, and from what I've told cute and mysterious which is appealing and alluring to a good amount of women.\n\nMy friends found me to be loyal and an awesome friend despite the fact that I never really called them due to my extreme introversion. Nonetheless I was quite popular amongst my friends and acquaintances regardless of if I always enjoyed having that many people want to talk to me.\n\nAll in all I feel like no matter your type life will be difficult if you not only focus on the shortcomings and perceived negative differences that make up who you are but try to fight against your natural inclinations. Acceptance and further understanding of yourself and how you improve and help others often leads people to accept and appreciate you more."", 'I agree with everything you\'ve said up there mr.intp OP.\n\nHowever, i think like any tool our personality is a very versatile one. As a INFP i borderline a E on the continuum...and notice my abilities...i can be quiet...mysterious...etc\n\nThese can be my down fall... as they are allureing, but i give up the ""chase"" to soon. As intenseity can take over...and sometimes be intrepreted as ""too emotionial"".\n\nSince we have powerful social abilities(i think i do...and the only infp i know does to) We read and adapt when someone can feel threatened by us, we makes many more ""competitive"" men see us as targets.\n\nIm not afarid to shed my ""I"" to give a nice speech, or be logical in a crushing debate...and my intense emotions can drive me to victory long after the oppoeny loses or gives up.\n\nI think overall it matters which culture your from, are you bullies? Are you with people who simply dont care? Do they kinda care? Are they patcient?\n\nBeing an INFP has been heartbreaking as far as romance is concerned its nearly impossible to figure out it feels like.\n\n', ""I would say that being an infp male is a mixed bag like most other types. Not conforming to social norms of masculinity definitely raises issues when dealing with immature individuals, so I'd say it comes up more as a kid/teen when you're relatively locked in with others who might be looking for someone to put down. The tricky part as an adult is learning to identify and avoid those individuals and also learning to trust that there are people out there who will accept and appreciate who you are.\nAlso trying to explain all the weird fantastical explanations for everything that seem like very distinct possibilities in our own minds. That gets tricky."", ""As an INFP male I agree 100%, given that I think my life experiences would be very different if I were not an NF (or even INFX). As a previous poster said, it's as difficult for a female INTJ because we don't conform to the expected gender norms and are taken less seriously, so are more likely to be in need of help/less happy because we are less adjusted to others."", ""It gets definitely better the older and more mature you get to be. Feeling comfortable in one's skin is great. It's almost like being invisible to the stares of the others and having a full freedom of perceiving things without any rush whatsoever. It's probably the best personality type for a man."", ""I feel this way partly, I only learned of the mbti in the last 2 weeks, if only I had known about it during high school, or hell college. I'd have understood me better at the very least, and maybe not been so adiment to change who I was, or start acting like society wanted me to.\nNow I feel like I'm just kind of shell, but that could just be my infp sensitivity that INTJs talk about on other forums."", ""I think this is highly culture/location dependent. In some cultures masculinity and femininity borders are blurred, and neither matter when forming an impression of someone. However most cultures are the exact opposite of that. So, perhaps it is true that us INFP males are quite unfortunate being born in a world we find hard to adjust to.\n\nPersonally speaking, I grew up in an environment that taught me that men are not allowed to cry, only to shout and give orders, and that women are only allowed to speak softly and submissively and not raise their voices... among many other things. As an INFP child, you can imagine how hard it was for me to accept how emotional I was. It was only until I was 16-17 and learned about MBTI that I've slowly started to come to terms with my emotional side and started to kill the correlation between femininity and showing emotion in my mind. Not that being perceived as feminine matters anymore to me, mind you. It doesn't carry a negative connotation to it as it used to in my head, thankfully.\n\nEdit: Just realized how old this thread was lol.

""Hi!! Just saw your post (sorry, I know it was a while ago) and I totally agree. It makes sense why my last relationship didn't work out - he was an infp and I had no idea until after that his feelings needed to be validated. I just took everything at face value."", 'ENTJ\nINTJ\nINFJ\nENFJ\nare supposed to be good pairings for us.\nUnfortunately, for us, they are all comparatively rare types. But to be fair, INTPs are pretty rare at ~3% but intp women are extremely rare at maybe ~1%.']","['Rationals', 'INTP - Architect', 'Personality']",INTP - Architect
215,261,How excitable are YOU?,"['I\'m constantly asked: ""How come you never get excited about stuff?"" Stuff usually meaning material things, famous people, or social gatherings. I just find those things boring or exhausting so of course I don\'t jump up and down with delight at the thought of them. I find my own thoughts and theories most exciting but, traveling or exploring new experiences in general is a close second. However, I\'m still not one to channel a female anime character as a way of expressing that excitement. I can\'t understand why or, how anyone can genuinely be like that. I\'m sure it weirds me out just as much my lack of reaction is strange to them. What do you think INTP thing or me thing also, what excites you?', 'I get excited about new ideas and experiences...and nerdy shit like Firefly and story arcs of comic books. But I think I generally maintain at least the illusion of reserve with these types of things (i.e. material things, whatever <insert celebrity here> is doing, social gatherings [exhausting, those!]). Even if something comes up that feels really exciting, the likelihood of seeming as wound up about it as everyone else is pretty slim, at least for me.', 'I\'ve had people ask me ""are/aren\'t you excited?!"" And I usually just respond with a yeah and a smile on my face, but definitely no physical energy will be exerted unless I want to act like a kid(which I do sometimes). I am not excited by new movies, celebrity updates, new music. I am generally excited by adventures, traveling, crafting something together, moments of getting to know other well, and seeing others excited or learning something new.\n\nThis just made me think..the question of ""what excites you"" could also be phrased "" what are you passionate about"" in the sense that if you are passionate about something, you are excited to hear and learn about. Do you guys agree? I feel like i\'m on a quest to find out what I am truly passionate about (I like to say, ""what makes me tick,"" sounds weird now that i said it, but what makes time pass..).', ""Hmm that's a good point Elmo. Learning, traveling and new experiences are all passions of mine as well as things I usually get excited about. Maybe this is a trait of intuitives in general because we prefer the abstract over the concreate most of the time. I'm glad you pointed that out because for some reason that never occured to be before.\n\nI completely understand about searching for your true passion. Lately I've been toying with the idea of possibly getting involved in a church in some way. However my personality isn't one that you might expect to find in a church...I'm a little sarcastic and a lot more facetious lol.\n\n"", 'I find if people are around I dont show my emotions though if I get good news via text there may be a one man party lol', 'I think we\'re very much excitable...just not for the mundane things other people usually get excited about. At least for me, I surprise people when I get excited over something ""random"" or ""spontaneous"", because I usually don\'t get excited. I express a childlike delight over a novel idea that just occurred to me or that I just overheard and the very rare fan girl moment (it has to be something I REALLY enjoy).\n\nI believe we get excited over pleasant surprises or spontaneity of things like ideas.', ""I get excited when new games come out I've been following. Or if new technology comes out. I get excited for new versions of Windows or Visual Studio.\n\nReal world wise... I get excited from chaos and destruction, as evil as that sounds... I recognize that you can't have great change without great destruction, and I like change because it presents the possibility for things to improve.\n\nFor example, I got excited when the road near my house had to be moved over 10 feet for an interstate lane nearby. Many businesses had to be torn down, and many were sad for the destruction. However I was excited, because that meant shiny new buildings when the old ones needed condemed anyways and potential for businesses we never had before due to land sales.\n\nI also got excited when a KFC got condemned, because they tore it down and rebuilt it to new health and safety standards and now I feel better about eating there.\n\nBut I've even gotten excited during tornadoes, and huricanes... Not because they have a good side, but because I am in awe of their natural power and beauty. I love just watching storms, and as a result find them extremely exciting.\n\nChaos excites me, truth.\n\nThat's because no matter how bad something is I always tend to see the positive side of it or what good could come out of it as a result. A great depression sucks, but it brought the whole country together to do something about it.\n\nOver time I've recognized that the only time the world works together to solve a problem is when their existence is in jeopardy. E.g. To unite many for any particular cause, you need a common problem.\n\nNow if you want to get into who won the Superbowl, or some celebrity getting caught cheating, or some protester traffic block.. I could care less about any of that stuff.\n\nI should note though that I am not evil, I don't get excited for all chaos, only chaos that has a positive side that benefits many, chaos that needed to happen. I still consider things like the 9/11 a great tragedy that should have never happened."", ""Get two INTPs in the same room with the same hobby and you will see a level of excitement that others would struggle to replicate. Grab two Trekkie INTPs that never met each other and come to find out they both thing Picard was the best captain...just get out of the way.\n\nOh, and be kind to the INTPs....come back in 6 hours and

217,263,The True Characteristics of a Soul Mate,"[""Hi fellow INFJs!\n\nI just stumbled on an enlightening and sobering talk about the true characteristics of a soulmate. Please don't be put off by the fact that the speaker (Lisa Killinger) is muslim - her perspective is relevant to any faith and to non-believers.\n\nThe talk is about 40 minutes long, and there's a short question period at the end. Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaU1d2YysKs\n\nIf you have chance to watch this video, please leave your comments!\n\nI will start with the first comment:\nI agree with Mrs. Killinger that a soulmate is a person who will stand by you in good and bad times. What I mean by 'bad times' is that if you were involved in an accident, and you were paralyzed from the waist down, this person would consistently help you with your personal hygiene needs. In turn, you would not hesitate to support them in the same way."", 'Thank you!']","['Romantics ', 'Personality', 'INFJ - Counselor']",INFJ - Counselor
218,264,EvoLove Review,"['I just want to say that I found this site by searching myer briggs dating on the web,\nafter I an and an INTJ friend spent a long time philosophizing over attraction\nand how personality types factor strongly into good relationships. Good relationships\nseem to consist of people who largely complement and agree with one another,\ntypically sharing two or three personality traits and the same instincts. And that\'s it!\n\nGender, ethnicity, age, beliefs, food preferences, none of it seems to matter. The\nsex side of thing manages itself in the end anyway, you can\'t force it, and who would\nintentionally sabotoge themselves through their fear of failure by overcomplicating\nexperiences and getting hung up internally on their shortcomings? Apparently\neveryone, but really, why not just surrender. Personally this evolove site\nfeels like surrender to me. A good kind!\n\nAs a web developer and user of nearly every single dating site that exists\n(I even tried to get into an exclusive scientology site), I feel that project\nevolove gets the closest to being an novel mechanism for paring that would,\nif it had the members, really pay off. Nearly everyone i\'ve searched for, regardless\nof my actual interest, seems interesting and like they would be fun to be around.\nI must suppose that at some level we all share some similar kind of neuroplasticity\nor selfawarness to even consider personality-based dating a possibility, which\nwould explain why so many minds seem so attractive.\n\nThe design is phenomenal, I havn\'t found any bugs (geek2geek crashed instantly)\nand I can see where the matching system could be extended in some ways that,\nfor instance, planetearthsingles doesn\'t or wont consider examining. I would like\nto propose a few of these ideas and get some feedback, but they arn\'t important-\nI will be sharing this site with people I know who are single even as is and I hope\nthey will use it. evolove appears to be a simple site that is nothing more or less\nthan what a matching site I would imagine would look like, pretty much what\nI had hoped okcupid would have become(strongest contender, that).\n\n23andme genetic info might be something to include in terms of personality traits\nthat are genetic. I would also consider trying to match people based on the moon\nsign of their birth, namely, the exact place the moon was when they were conceived\ndoes have some effect on them, and it may be due to programmed circadian rythym\ninitalization on conception that ties into instinctual wiring in the developing brain.\n\nI personally feel like the 16 personalities the MBTI is programmed with are limited,. sometimes I fluctuate between thinking and feeling, sometimes between sensing\nand intuition, it all depends on the time of day and situation- the only consistent\nthing about me is that i\'m perceptive and introverted. Same thing for these\nthree instincts that evolove relies on. I can see that they are accurate and it is true\nthat most people fall into one of the 9 provided categories pretty accurately, but\nit seems to me that there aught to be big labels next to certain profiles containing\nincompatible personalities or even compatible but likely friends personalities that\nread ""WARNING, FRIENDZONE IMMINANT"" or something similar after you acknowledge\nthe reason for messaging them. And on that note, why not have seperate mailboxes and\nrequire people to check a flag when messaging indicating the reason for their message-\nit would make it far easier to determine malicious solicitation. If someone messages you\nclaiming to want friendship but is clearly not interested in that, they\'re oblivious and you\nshould block them immediately. And if lots of people block someone, that person might\nneed to be informed they\'re not going about this properly and helped somehow,\notherwise it wont matter if they match- they\'re going to ruin their chances a lot.\n\nDoes anyone else have any thoughts or factors that might compliment the instinct +\npersonality design of project evolove?',

I\'ve never had sex with anyone that I wasn\'t romantically involved with, so my opinion is probably biased. lulz.', ""@Metalheart I don't think it's unusual, I think it depends on how much you like stimulating your Sensing preference. Personally I don't usually enjoy activities that don't involve thought in some way, but there are a couple of exceptions for me (music as a sensory experience, etc).\n\nBehaviorally, I'm of a mind with Zenith, and consider sex as an intimate-only activity that requires a strong emotional /and/ intellectual bond. Part of that comes from not really being able to objectify people, but it's mostly because I look for fulfillment in anything I do.\n\nSo you're not alone there."", 'For me sex has to have some kind of connection, but it does not have to be romance.\nI think sex has so much social stigma surrounding it, we call all berate ourselves for not falling within social norms, but when we are just us, doing it the way we do, thats right for us and our partner, maybe thats the most beautiful kind of sex - and anyway whats normal?\n', 'Empty meaningless sex? Nope. Very unappealing,\n\n', ""ISTP's are usually very happy with sex and no romance."", 'I am not going to say I\'ve never had, shall we call it a casual romantic encounter? And there have been times when I\'ve sought it out in lieu of having a deeper connection.\n\nI think the natural state of most humans is for sex to be within the context of a generally monogamous relationship. It leads to fewer hurt feelings. I largely believe there is a biological connection here that must go back about 250,000 years or so. By this I mean that if the female is incapacitated with a child, she\'s depending on the male to hunt and provide for her. So should a woman trust a man enough to want physical connection, she wants him to stay with her, at least, for awhile. It\'s genetically programmed. And when a woman has sex with a man, the man will feel, generally speaking, more attracted to her. I also largely believe this is programmed.\n\nAnyway, I think most people would prefer to have sex within monogamous (or generally so) relationships. Me? I crave that 1 on 1 connection with someone who ""gets"" me (and I them), someone I find fun to be with and who is my intellectual match. So, yeah, monogamy when I find a deep relationship is what I\'m seeking.\n\nWas chatting with a coworker (INFJ) who has a friend who was involved in a polyamorous relationship. Deep down, the friend admitted that she wasn\'t in it for very long because it bred jealousy. Not saying that a group relationship couldn\'t or wouldn\'t work, but I don\'t think it\'s something that I\'d prefer, variety or not. I\'m looking for sex within a deep connection. Would think it hard to find in polyamory, and particularly within polyandry.', 'http://www.thomas-sabos.com.de/, http://www.oakley-outletonline.com.co/, http://www.soccershoes-outlet.com/,

My interest in MBTI was sparked at that point.', ""Haha I see...\n\nDid you find find it credible at first?\n\nI didn't, until I started researching cognitive functions and what not."", ""Hehe, I can sense the enthusiasm of the new user in your post. I've been on the site for a few months but others have been on it for years, which tells me this perhaps will stay pretty much hidden and uninhabited from the mainstream. You can argue the pros and cons of that statement, for I've met more interesting characters on this site with more substance and intellectual thought than in any other.\n\nTo answer your question, I found out about MBTI after reading one of John Maxwell's books, during a time when I was obsessed with growth and development books. So not all was lost. lol."", ""I thought of it as a toy or mental candy at first really, where it appeared interesting, but I didn't give it too much credence, since I saw that the theory was built upon generalizations. Later when I became interested in psychology, I read into cognitive functions, the ego, super-ego, and id, as well as other related concepts and I had a refined interest in it again. Now I look at it, as a proposed theoretical organization of cognitive functions and their relations towards each other.\n\nHow about yourself, how did you find out about MBTI?\n\nThis is a really fun site for me at least. Its like its own mini social experiment, where you can throw spaghetti at a wall, and see what the wall does or how it reacts. Welcome to the site and hope you enjoy it! ^_^"", '@olivetwist:\nThat sounds appealing. :) I\'d rather have quality than quantity. This is the first ""dating site"" that I\'ve joined, so I really have no idea what to expect. I love the idea of having one\'s psychological preference be the initial impression though! And same question to you -- did you initially find MBTI credible?\n\n@Mishaoesrawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwrrrr (I\'m wondering where the name came from btw. >.< ):\nInteresting! I had a similar initial encounter with it.\n\nI was in a high school psych class and we were introduced to various personality ""instruments"" such as the enneagram and MBTI. I initially thought that it was interesting (in the ""categorization for the lulz"" kinda way) but then I found out that it\'s pretty legit. Sure, it\'s still generalized to an extent, as all qualitative analysis is, but it serves as a great tool for self-improvement and knowledge, as well as a quick and dirty system to orient myself on what to expect from certain social patterns.\nI read up on the cognitive functions and the role that they play in distinct preferences, and also on the perception of self - the subconscious, unconscious, precociousness, etc (more psychoanalysis) and it all wove in beautifully.\nYay for experimentation!!! I\'ve had the idea of closely befriending all 16 types and then scheduling interactions to see how they behave. Haha.', 'I first did an MBTI test about five years ago when I saw a counsellor, however it was only a few years later I became passionate about it and did more reading.', 'I agree, with your summary Zenith. I still believe that individual personality eclipses MBTI, but MBTI is a quick and dirty rundown, of an individual you may not know as well. For me personally, I use MBTI to learn more about myself. Its helped me identify what my primary cognitive functions are, and methods of refining them, as well as spending time around other individuals with more well developed inferior functions (for me Si and Fe), to improve my weaknesses. It can\'t hurt, and I believe that I\'m making progress in acheiving a more well rounded and balanced state.\n\nCurrently my only fib with MBTI, is that its self-administered. Meaning that the person taking the test paints a subjective image of themselves and answers questions as how they see themselves rather than objectively how they act as individuals. Thus confirmation bias and belief preservance may significantly interfere with the outcome.\n\nI\'ve tried doing something like that in real life. The only people that I have not interacted with deeply are ENFJ (borderline personality disorder individual, may be innacurate), ESTJ (its like they don\'t exist in my world), ESFP (elementary school stalker kid who liked me a lot), and ESFJ (only at work). So I don\'t have an accurate image of how I interact with those individuals.\n\nConcerning my name: I go by Misha, and I used to have a cat. When the cat would \'meow\' it sounded like a \'reow\' sound, and its purs sounded like a sputtering engine going rrrrrrrrrr. So I figured I would combine all said elements and make that name. This is also how I tend to talk to people I like a lot ""rawwwwwwrrrrrr""\n\n\n\n', ""Did a search for personality tests a year ago, I felt there just had to be one that's as expansive as this. Wanted to find something that justifies my weirdness and uniqueness that made me never belong anywhere. Before that, I was beginning to categorize people of my own. Fun fact that Jung himself was an INFJ."", '@Zenith Haha, Wow all 16 huh? Very ambitious. I found the MBTI to be fairly accurate. I paid for the whole process, which I think was a lot more accurate than bubbling my responses to the questions. I found that my ""idea"" of who I thought I was filled in the answers differently than what the reality of things was. So initially I was an ENFJ, but then the curator, who was some doctor trained to conduct the MBTI test, called me and went through each trait thoroughly. I found out at the end I was INFJ. Although I do identify with many of the INFJ traits, I don\'t hold on to it too tightly, as I understand people grow and develop and evolve into other things. I take this is a loose guideline that happens to be very accurate.', ""I was just looking around online trying to see if I wasn't alone in the world (classic INFJ) and when I saw the MBTI it was awesome, like a weight lifted from me ^_^"", '""I\'m new to this place (as you can tell haha) and it seems kinda... deserted. ""\nFun Fact- If you do a blank search, you can see how many users are on the site. In total now, there are 7,712 members; so yes. pretty empty. Quality of quantity, I imagine. Have fun!', '@mishagoesrawrrrrrrrrrrrr!: When I initially encountered MBTI, I knew nothing of cognitive functions (and the fact that the 4 letters are a mere algorithm for their order) so I had difficulty defining ""what"" I was. <Also, not to mention that I was still in a VERY strong identity seeking stage of my life> I saw myself as an ENTJ (because they were intense and intellectual), and then an INTP (because of the webbed thinking and connections, connections, connections!) After reading up on Ne, it was very apparent that it was my dominant function. The Ti/Fi dichotomy still hold a very close tie, so I see myself as ""bordering ENTP"" in the spectrum. :)\n\nI don\'t have tons of sensor friends either. :P I don\'t think I\'ve ever befriended an ESTJ. I\'ve tried, but their rigid dispositions regarding traditions and mannerisms turn me off. I love to explore new ideas and ""ways"" and this apparently makes them tick alottttt. lol\n\nAhh I see. :p Makes total sense now XD', ""@AndyCroat: Hmm, was he an INFJ? That's interesting. :)\nIt's awesome how it can help you understand yourself. I definitely felt more comfortable expressing who I was after MBTI!!!\n\n@StevenB: Ahh another INFJ! It seems like there's a relatively large ratio of you guys here. It's odd because I'm generally not around many INFJ's, though I'd like to. What type do you tend to gravitate towards?\n\n@Red5: Nice. So not EXACTLY deserted but somewhat inactive, lol. I'm actually surprised and the amount of replies. This seems like it'll be a good experience, thanks!\n\n"", ""@OliveTwist:\nAhh.. I've always wondered what it would be like to go to an actual site to get tested. What kind of questions do they ask? Did they make you engage in any activities other than a questionnaire? (I've found the online test to be pretty shallow. It's like, yes, I like spending time alone and would rather stay in many nights, but my Ne preference is very high lol)\nHmm I see. You weren't far off!"", ""@Zenith There are alot of us online! Its surprising considering we make up just 1-2% of the population. It must be because we seek to be understood so we love MBTI. For me I love ENFP's, ENTP's, ENTJ'S, ENFJ's and INFJ's the most, we just click really well which is awesome. But i'm quite the social chemeleon so I get along with just about anyone"", '@Zenith Welcome aboard! The few of us who /are/ on are quite active.\n\nA few years ago, my high school was experimenting with psychological profiles, so I took a MBTI test with a larger group of students. Back then, I didn\'t think much of the classifications, but reading Jung\'s work and observing the type dynamics in my family has led me to believe that it is generally predictive, all other things being equal. The one thing you have to remember is that each of the cognitive functions is on a spectrum, and that personality preference isn\'t necessarily the greatest influence on behavior.\n\nWhat do you think about the ""instincts"" attributes that this site incorporates?', ""I am working on a software which will analyze the android cell phone data and try to get the MBTI from that. Can't give more details here but that's pretty much the jist. If able to do this the system will be an impartial judge and will be able to predict most correctly subjected to my model errors(if any) only. Seriously want to go a lot more in detail bt sadly can't :("", '', '', ""I came to the site in a measure to prove myself wrong. I hadn't met another INTJ female and I wanted to prove to myself that I wasn't the only one around. Until I saw with my own eyes that there were other INTJs seeking connections, I had a bit of a Schrodinger's phenomenon going on - other INTJs both did and did not exist until I looked for myself."", 'I had online ENTJ male friend who took the MBTI test and suggest it to me', 'hey, intp here, not new....been here a few months.....\n\n\nnot found anyone that could interest me for more than a few

227,273,Conversing with an INTJ,"['I found an incredible post and I think we can complete it with our own viewpoints:\n\n* Reference: http://intjcentral.com/the-compleat-idiots-guide-to-the-intj/3/\n\nDo?™s and Don?™ts:\n\nDON?™T ask one of us a question unless you really want a truthful answer. We will not sugarcoat it for you, and we don?™t tell white lies to spare anyone?™s feelings. Do you really, truthfully want to know if those jeans make your ass look fat? Normal person?™s response: ?œUm, no, you look fine. Really.??Honest person?™s response: ?œWell??maybe a different belt would help???INTJ?™s response: ?œNo, it?™s not the jeans that make your ass look fat; it?™s your fat ass that makes your ass look fat.?\n\nDON?™T express an opinion to us unless you are prepared to back it up with sound arguments and well pedigreed facts and evidence. Otherwise do not be surprised when we logically shred your opinion for you and hand it back to you in tatters.\n\nDON?™T be repetitive. We have absolutely no patience for that. There?™s no need to cover old ground, and we heard you the first time, unless we were zoning out. And if we were zoning out it?™s probably because you started repeating yourself.\n\nDON?™T take 100 words to say what could have been said in 10. Content-free speech will cause an INTJ to zone out faster than repeating yourself.\n\nDON?™T engage us in ?œsmall talk?? Keep in mind that you are competing for our attention with all the voices in our heads, and they are bound to be far more interesting than you. The voices are constantly regaling us with things like anagrams of Wayne Newton (Wanton Weeny, We Annoy Newt, New Yawn Tone, ?? and candidate titles for parodies of ?œCarry On My Wayward Son??(?œCary Grant Was Six Foot One?? ?œCurry On My Egg Foo Yung?? ??. Do you really think your talk of the weather or your six year old?™s soccer league is going to be more compelling than that? Please. Be realistic.\n\nDON?™T look at an INTJ in bewilderment when he/she discloses an idea to you. Yes, it may have required a double somersault of imagination to reach their conclusion. Ask them to take you through it step-by-step; they will happily oblige. Ideas are of ultimate importance to an INTJ, and it is a compliment for them to share their ideas with you. Similarly, failing to give due attention to an INTJ?™s idea is a high form of insult.\n\nDO??um??well, we thought there should be at least one ?œDO??but we can?™t think of one. Oh, how about this: DO keep it short.\n\n* Continue with your own viewpoint about what do or what dont.', ""LOL too true. too true. (but I digress - And broke at least 2 rules: repetition and not sticking to the point.)\n\nBut this was summed up rather nicely from what I know from personal experience. (and now I get a 'kudos' point for letting you know how rapt you had me at attention.)\n\nEnd result: still -1\n\nWho is your favorite MB type?"", 'DO find something of intellectual interest to the INTJ and talk about that. If you can challenge their views, with good arguments and/or interesting facts, even if just as a devils advocate or in jest (perhaps by skewering social conventions and assumptions).\n\nDONT expect small talk to get you very far.', 'DONT make a habit of trying to ""fill in the blanks"" in an INTJs words. (enjoy playing with fire, do you?) We tend to say exactly what we mean. If you need more info, its almost always going to be better to ask first.\n', 'As long as you give us the time to get everything we want to say out everything works out just fine. We got a lot of stuff in our heads so trying to get it out to where someone else can understand it takes time.', ""DON'T ever try to manipulate an INTJ with emotion. They will lose respect for you.\n\nDO be blunt. Even what you would consider rude to say to many other types, if it needs to be said, don't sugar coat it, just say it. We wont be offended unless what you have to say isn't worthy of out attention."", ""The problem I have the most is that I simply don't want to converse with most people. After a life of banging my head against the walls trying to find some glimpse of understanding in the average person's eyes, I've learned to not expect people to understand me. I'm accustomed to being labeled a weirdo and excluded from social cliques. But what I love is when people seek my advice or help while genuinely receptive and vulnerable. I love tinkering under the hood of other people.\n\nIf an INTJ initiates a conversation with you, listen extremely closely and do not ask them to repeat themselves. Give them your full attention because, unless they are attracted to you and trying to show interest, they are in some way trying to help or enlighten you.\n\nIf an INTJ is extremely short or ignores you, they think you are beneath them and your existence bothers them."", ""I never knew the repetition thing was an INTJ thing!!!? Repetition drives me insane but I always thought it was an Aries thing due to how hot-headed I can get.\n\nLiterally if I'm in a store and I hear a mother calling her kid, by the third time she calls its name I am murderous."", ""It's simple, you have to take a risk and initiate the conversation, if we are interested we will reply, if we are not, we won't.

228,274,Calling all ENTPs! Let's talk!,"[""Hey all! Everything I've read online (and of course, the internet is an infallible wellspring of insight) has taught me that we INFJs and you ENTPs should have a very good rapport. The only problem is, I don't think I know any ENTPs. Two of my best friends are ENFPs, so I definitely understand the Ne-Ni synergy that's unleashed when these types happen to wander into the same room. However, you ENTPs have proved to be much more elusive! Still, I definitely want to test this hypothesis, so please extend a brotherly or sisterly hand to an INFJ friend in need, and give me a shout :)."", ""Well, I am apparently an ENTP, who thought they were an INTP. LOL! So...Hi! I know a number of INFJs and I find them very intriguing, though it's probably because they are such an enigma to me, more so than any other Intuitive type. You are the one type I cannot seem to understand. You are shrouded in mystery and I haven't figured out if this is good or bad yet...."", ""Haven't logged on in a few months. Currently dating an INFJ. We've lasted about 10 months. She's 21 and I'm 22. In college. I'm a Mathematics Major and she's Behavioral Neuroscience. It's a pretty damn nice relationship with few, but major flaws.\nIf it weren't a relationship, it would probably be one of the better friendships I've ever had, but her emotional needs are simply too great for me. I'm not exactly the best at empathizing if I don't have a logical root from which to trace the motivation. This could also be due to my own personal history and her personal history clashing rather than a difference in ENTP and ENFJ personality types though.\n\nWell that went on a tangent. Mainly for the benefit of SabinaLea.\n\nAnyways, what's up? What'd you want to know?\n\nP.S. I'm at the end of my semester so may not respond with all due haste, so feel free to write a monologue and I'll respond in kind when I remember to check. I'll check by Friday at the latest, I promise :)"", ""Hey Silver, just wanted to give you my own two cents, regarding the issue on empathizing you have raised in your commentary about your relationship with your INFJ girlfriend.\nI'd like to let you know, that with time, INFJs mature to become much more reasonable, emotionally wise, when they understand how to systematically arrange their sensibility to the world, in other words, to put on filters, and let in the only real valuable aspects of their sensitivity.\nI speak from personal experience, I understand how much of a deep burden of feelings we can be when we are overwhelmed by love, particularly when there are no set boundaries in relationship as to how much we can share, and want to be relatable to the significant others.\nGive it time and space, and the INFJ will learn to thread lightly emotionally around the person they care for, even if it may seem like a sacrifice to them at first..\nI say that because I have been that person to a good ENTP friend of mine, who just couldn't handle me in my hyper phases of sensationalist intuition !\n\nFrom what you've said, I can only assume that you are still together, so maybe you can work together in setting a few boundaries, sensibly wise, and maybe help her to understand feelings can be heavy to other people, and to learn to sympathize,\nthat is to understand the other's feelings without necessarily feeling them, to put on filters on what really needs emotional investment, and what can be left out..\n\nGood luck in your endeavours! I hope this piece of personal advice was helpful."", ""Interesting reply. I appreciate it. However, I already made up my mind roughly 5 months ago.\nI truly enjoy the relationship, and I even love her, which is wonderful, but it will not be a long term thing.\nI fully agree with your analysis of the maturity and time necessary for the development of the INFJ in regards to dealing with essentially any of the rational types (4 of them), but her position is unique due to past stuff. Just your standard skeletons in the closet type deal. It's unfortunate really, but it is what it is. There's simply one or two fundamental flaws that are not subject to change since they are core to her being.\n\nMy main concern, and potentially you could help with this, is how to end it. There just doesn't seem to be a good way, especially when we're both so happy.\nDon't worry if it doesn't make sense. As with all things, there's a lot left unsaid.\n\n\nAaaaand now the thread is entirely derailed :)\nhahaha"", 'I have dated a couple INFJ guys and have grown to love them immensely but there are these walls. I actually had a chat with an INFJ guy online not too long ago and asked them why they have such walls that shut people out. His response was that they have to keep some things to themselves. I then asked, ""even from the ones you love?"" He said Yes. My response, ""Then how can you have love without letting them in? If you can\'t trust them, there is no point in the relationship."" He never responded back. I think I may have hit a nerve on that one. Though, I have seen this wall in every INFJ I have ever encountered. I love them to death, but I also have trust issues with them. It\'s even amazing how the INFJ and ENFJ are so different. I have no issues with my ENFJ friends...as they are open books.\n\nAnd, how did you derail?

No dates or whatsoever.\n\nnot that hard to talk to peeps, its just...most of them are either boring or fake. seems like they\'re here just to compete what shit.\nnot that hard to meet boys, its just...they fap to your pics and be so damn chill. they be too chill to ask girls out.\n\nI know this high school counselor who once went to a ""prestigi0us"" college and hates everything there.\n\nwhat do you say, how do you look at ""prestigi0us"" college?\n', 'my point of view: who cares, youll get a great education. id trade all my friends for it.', '', '', ""Concerning your self-perception:\nYou are angsty lol. However you are honest with yourself\n\nConcerning s-kkk-ools:\nI never went to a prestigi0us college, but I did partake in University. If you don't mind my asking; what is your major and what college are you going to? You mentioned that you were an international student. Where did you previously go to school?\n\nIt appears that you are disillusioned with peers at your school and the general culture/environment you are encompassed in. As you have observed, you noticed that many people there are in-genuine and 'fake'. Anywhere you go in life, you will meet people who are in-genuine and people who are not, as well as this insincerity can be situation to people who may be genuine. Its all part of the human condition. In society, most of us are thrown into positions where we have to juggle lies and trade in our identities for roles as well as put on a mask. When you interact with most people at first, you will most likely be talking to a mask. Most people are conditioned to uphold an image, and there is a certain panorama of images that are valuable to society, and the rest get discarded; or how I look at it; have a smaller audience.\n\nAlso, let's talk about college itself. What is your end goal that you want to achieve? In life or with college? You have to figure that out first, before wasting time and accumulating regrets, as it appears you have expressed.\nCollege or a Presitgi0us school is not for everyone. I know its not for me. But I have ideas, plans, future aspirations and am partaking actions in the world to make it happen. School may not be a necessary step for your values and dreams. As long as you have a realistic plan, for whatever you want to do in life, go for it. Currently I'm opening up a business and performing music. I did not need college to accomplish that; however I needed knowledge, persistence, and a plan that I can constantly adjust to my changing life goals and values.\n\nIf school may help you accomplish a goal you want to see; the why should you give a fuckk about any in-genuine person. They are simply not worth your time. It doesn't mean you should disregard or disrespect them,that would be immature. However, know that they don't play a significant role in your life, and leave it at that.\n\nConcerning high school counselor:\nThis is anecdotal evidence for your argument. You are supporting your claim, with another persons' claim. It is not objective, or does not elaborate on the argument.\nEvery person is biased and plays with life differently and has different life perception. The experience you mention is his, whereas there's countless other people who have an opposite perception of the exact same event.\n\nI'm not one to judge anybody's circumstance, however although this counselor went to a prestigi0us college, he ended up becoming a high school counselor. I could be wrong, but it sounds like he probably didn't envision himself becoming this type of counselor. His resentment for college, could be stemmed from various places as well as potentially his outcome for his life. Everybody has this idea, that going to college will let them 'pursue their American dream', but that's not true. It takes much more effort and drive, then just going to school.\n\nConcerning boiiiiiiiiiiiiiii:\nYou obviously could tell that they are apathetic, unless you find that attractive, just keep passively searching. Identify something you enjoy, and get immersed in it. Then partake in social activities similar to your interest here and there, and you may eventually find someone you are interested in.\n\nThere are many males who are apathetic like this and are interested in getting their sec(x). Not all, but many. So ignore them, they are not worth your time. Also from observation, many relationships at this age, fall apart easily with many correlational reasons. Some reasons include: undeveloped frontal lobe, not enough life experience, limited perception, etc etc etc\n\nJust find your thing. Do your thing. Chill. People you like will enter your life. But also give an effort.\n\nConcerning general current life perception:\nMost people are in college, to get through college, and nothing else for the most part. But I guess that's also where your social communication is as well. When I was going to college, most of my communication was outside of school. Try to find people in school who feel the same way, and search for what you would constitute as a 'genuine' person. Find these people by volunteering/working/participating in another place outside of school, and try to connect to people. Don't expect them to come to you, for the most part they won't.\n\nAs you grow older, start working, interact with others, discover more about yourself; more than likely your perception of school and your current situation will more than likely change. With every step in life and discovery, you will re-evaluate your goals. Generally keep that in mind, and make your choices wisely.\n\nConcerning Reel 3D lyfe @ 24 fps:\nEventhough society frowns at this, there is nothing wrong with living a hedonistic lifestyle. As long as you are accepting of the pros and cons after evaulation and experience. There is no right or wrong way to live life. So don't feel that you have to live up to expectations. We live in an age of grand illusion, super-ego over-inflation, and self-entitlement. Set your own path and be accepting of what happens, and constantly figure a way to grow as a person in whatever way it may be.\n\nI am not objective about any of this and this is just my current view, since I tend to view the world through moral relativism.\n\nConcerning attitude:\nI may be wrong, but it sounds like you are stressed and a bit jaded. Do you know what you want to do with your life?\nTry not to focus on the shortcomings and negative aspects of your life. Find what you value and what matters to you and pursue it\n\nConcerning happiness:\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA :)\n"", ""You have low expectations. You'll gaurd and miss out on opportunities of exactly what you think you can't find?¤ï?"", ""Mmm, yes you're right happiness is what really matter, but that depends on what makes you happy. A good education makes me happy now and later. It's just a different point of view. I'm sorry you're not enjoying it. I'd trade places! :D"", ""Mmm, yes you're right happiness is what really matters, but that depends on what makes you happy. A good education makes me happy now and later, whilst friends might make me happy temporarily.. It's just a different point of view. I'm sorry you're not enjoying it. I'd trade places! :D"", ""I see what you guys are saying, but prestige doesn't necessarily translate into quality. Plus, a setting conducive to learning for one individual wouldn't necessarily suit another. But I think Brianna has a very good point, every cloud has a silver lining, Utopianfish, there must be other students interested in similar things to you hiding somewhere in your university, maybe with them you can find your niche and get the most out of the experience :)"", ""I am also an international student in a renewed school. there is some folks going on all about competition, but a lot of them are really interesting individuals. ( also, some don't give a damn about competition stuff. )\nThere is a reason they got accepted after all !! Just do try to talk to a lot of people and you will eventually find one or two that you do get along with. It isn't that rare to find mind-alike people ( or even, if they are different they may give you some interesting perspective ), you just have to search ;o Good Luck"", 'Looks like you found one already. See!', ""Wouldn't know, I went to school online at Kaplan University with a Programming Major and I don't regret it for a second."",

An INFP I hadn't known very long, for example, was very eager to share his poetry with me. It could just be me though, an INFP friend once told me I have a look on my face that says 'tell me about your life.' But yeah, INFPs, great folks.

I welcome being approached with a typically friendly manner. I think I'm at least a little closed-off though in contrast to what Sam was saying. I do tend to avoid the attention and it's mostly because I don't like being put on the spot. Especially when it's about describing myself. Though this really depends what the situation is.

248,297,Lying vs personal growth as an ENTP,"['(Firstly, this is ONE thought and I just ran with it. There are other angles. My case is not complete. There\'s more. In your responses, lets get to somewhere positive. I know its hard for us but try please. I say that because there are some people who are REALLY struggling with life. Some have had it REALLY hard. We have answers to a lot of things. Help and we could be helping people but just looking into this ONE thought I had. Well, others probably have had it its just I\'m writing it here as its new FOR ME. I have not re-read or edited it. There are typos and incomplete arguments). You\'ve been warned. It is messy. Read at your peril.\n\nI want to start this new thread for the sole purpose of getting feedback from other ENTPs. Now, if you\'re not ENTP, please, feel free to pitch in, give you views, opinions, based on fact or otherwise. Just know, that SOMETIMES, there might be an ENTP out there who will come down hard on your post (not you, the individual, just what you said or how your ""thinking was wrong, illogical"" etc etc).\n\nNow, I don\'t class myself, and my VARIOUS test results have shown also, as a pure ENTP. I am also INTP I\'m also ESTP, I am whatever I am at the time I take the test. All over the span of a few days, not months of maturity, or what have! Anyhow, moving on.\n\nWith that in mind, and meeting (on here anyhow) a few ENTPs, and learning and meeting other ""types"", its dawned on me, that there are times when we, ENTPs mke an extra effort to gel, get along, keep the peace, protect other people\'s feelings, etc,etc. Basically, not be ourselves. Now. Hear me. If you have matured (as I am trying to do, and heave done to a huge extent, and that is why, I personally think, I am getting different test scores), then this is not really for you to consider, but your views on HOW you matured are welcome.\n\nMy thinking is that, as an ENTP, I CANNOT STAND liars! Or lying. I don\'t lye, I don\'t like others to lye to me. I don\'t like half truths, or mis-communicate deliberately hiding the truth. I am a sceptic. But, I believe people. Until they prove otherwise worthy of my trust (which, unfortunately is usually pretty quickly from the first time they said ""they are on route!"", when they haven\'t even gotten into the shower, let along driving down the road to our rendez-vous. Liar! (haha).\n\nThis leads me to my current dilema.\n\nWhen we as ENTPs bite our toungue, whih we invariably do A LOT in we are employees, and as employers otherwise we might/would have law suits on our hands left right and centre, are we in fact lying. We are choosing to act incongruous with what we determine as absolute truth. We are not being ourselves (usually for the sake of other people, not because we give a shit what people will think about us, or not losing friends, lovers, etc, etc). Its for the sake of the WHOLE, that we choose to, for want of a better phrase, ""mature"" (ie, change) into something that is beneficial to both ourselves, but more importantly, our relationships/society. We are the ones who point out the flaws. We are the risk takers without the crazy irresponsibility behind us. We are the intuitive, forward thinking, bright sparks that know, somehow, that there is a better way to do things. We are the catalyst for change. Yes, other types can do it. Its just we DO do it. Almost without trying or thinking about it (I mean planning to do it, it just rises up in us from nowhere).\nYes, we are objective, yes we see trends, patterns, etc. But, we focus on ""its not working, lets change something"". We look to the future, not the past. Well, maybe we all go about it differently.\n\nWhat I\'m trying to say is that a lie is a lie. Period. But, and in true ENTP form, the facts need interpretation. For me, its usually not the lie itself that is the problem, its the fact you lied. That is a personal thing to me - you didn\'t trust me with the truth. Or respect me. or whatever. You put yourself before me and lied to get what you wanted without even COMMUNICATING (another pet peev of mine). If you\'d have communicated, I could have gone with it. You assumed I would have ""X"" reaction/response, so lied to avoid that. Its kindof circular in that the liar lied to get themselves out of a situation with an ENTP only not be so, forgive me now, ""stupid"" to not realise they would be digging another one for themselves. They did it all. Pointless.\n\nNow, as an imature ENTP I will argue tooth and nail why what they did was ""bang out of order"". Or ""wrong"", for those of you not from these parts! Round and round it goes. One personality type trying to convince the other they were wrong, etc etc, boring boring. Well, now its boring to me when its the SAME person, or type of people, again and again. I like an argument, but I also like to WIN the argument. Winning for me is knowing that the other person KNOWS (not admits) they are wrong. And, as an ENTP, ""I KNOW"", when they know. We just know stuff. Am I right?\n\nSo coming back to it, I have a choice now as I seek to ""moniotr and control"" my natural ENTP response. Do I let it go? Let them lie and not say anything? Show calm even though I\'m raging inside? Surely yes! For growth, to reduce stress, to be happy in more than the instant gratification of ""blowing up"" and arguing, and winning. Can I bare losing? Can I live with not being in control? Not being in control of other people, I mean, being someone elses punching bag, or being taken advantage of because I CHOOSE not to stand my ground or fight my cause, or whatever else way you justify your ENTP behaviour.\nGrowth surely is the process of change. Change for an ENTP I think, is VERY VERY tricky. Other types have it down-right hard!! Yes, its hard for them because of society, life, feelings of already being ""out of control"". Man, they have it HARD!\n\nI like to think we ENTPs have a CHOICE! Not because we are ""all that"", though we clearly are. haha. But seriously, we are.\n\nWe can choose to be ""something we are not"" in order to get what we want, or make things better, or imrove ourselves and others, etc. So we lie. We lie when our boss says ""does anyone have anything to ad?"". OF COURSE WE DO!!! We can turn the whole organisation on its head and make a few more %age profit!! Of course we do!! We could fire, X, Y Z employee and get a better return on our sales figures!! Of course we do!!! We could....we could... we could... (ad infinitum).\n\nYou get the picture. And that\'s just ONE meeting. ONE!\n\nOne!\n\nSo we lie. We keep our hand down. Smile. Keep the peace.\nIn relationships in has to be the same way. ""Honey, is everything ok?"". Answer. ""NO! I missed my squash meet because you were 20mins late and I could have changed the time but you said you were on route, and there was no traffic, but you lied"". Real answer. ""Yeah. I have some things on my mind, but I\'m ok"". Which is true. But you are actually WORKING on being ok, cause you are actually pissed off. This is not the first, second or third time. Or the twentieth time this EXACT scenario has happened. Its just you oh dear ENTP, have FINALLY, decided you WILL NOT win with this person. YOU must change or leave. Sometimes we can\'t leave. Yes, we detach emothionally but we can\'t physically leave. Or we can leave them, but must still interact with them ALL THE TIME. Eg, at work, or because of kids, or shared relations (by marriage not because we married our cousins, or whatever people decide to do!?!?). You get my point. We adapt!!\n\nSo I\'m learning to lie. I don\'t like it but I\'m trying. I;m experimenting with lying for the sake of lying. Kind of like, ""if I can do it when it doen\'tmean anything to anyone, then I can learn what it means to LIVE WITH MY LIE (or rather live with the fact I lied, when I hate lying!) so when I am in a situation that DEMANDS me NOT to be my true ENTP, take me as I am, blah blah blah, I am better able to do what needs to be done. We will hurt people along the way. We will hurt ourselve. They probably would\'ve been hurt in a different way by us offending them, or whatever but at least now we are CHOOSING to try something as see if it is a BETTER way. That is what we do after all. Yes, I want the change to occur for the company. Yes I want to move forward in my relationship. But I am smart enough to know when I, yes, me, am the only who can get this thing working, and to do, I need to be ""all things to all men"".\n\nWe can do it. If anyone can look at a lie and convince the world its a good thing, its us ENTPS. If anyone can go so far off the beaten track in order to find our way back to it its US. The question is...can we be bothered! I for one am trying to determine whether I can or not. And yes, in true ENTP style, I may do it for a while and get bored, then go bak to being me again. Hahahaha. Poor ENTPs!!\nThanks for reading. Please respond.\nDavid', '""My thinking is that, as an ENTP, I CANNOT STAND liars! Or lying. I don\'t lye, I don\'t like others to lye to me. I don\'t like half truths, or mis-communicate deliberately hiding the truth. I am a sceptic. But, I believe people. Until they prove otherwise worthy of my trust..."" Love this--very true of me, too. I\'m very direct, straight-forward, and honest--and I just assume everyone else is, too. NOT! Boy, have I been burned as a result! :(\n', 'Did you ever hear about the functions? It really expands the MBTI experience. And is great for solidifying what type you are and for being more aware of your own thoughts and why you have conflicts with people. ENTP is Ne-Ti-Fe-Si. This is my favorite video series for explaining it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wAlL99vDn4\n\nI\'m curious about what you\'re actually upset about.\nWe can\'t easily appreciate double-checking or redundancy. We get bored and disengaged with school because of how much review and work for the sake of work there is. Most meetings are just about going over things, right?\n\nI think comparing holding your tongue to lying or being inauthentic sounds like a bit of an exaggeration. It\'s close but maybe there were better words. You want something to be different, but you don\'t want to be an asshole more. Which would make people think less of you and not be effective. It\'d be inauthentic to me to yell at your girlfriend in that example. You don\'t actually hate her or want to blame her, do you? But it\'s also not authentic or a good idea, Things weren\'t fine. ""I missed you these past 20 minutes."" ""Aww. BB. I\'ll make it up to you.""\nIt\'s always helpful to learn how to communicate your thoughts and feelings to people. If you can feel more comfortable knowing you won\'t hurt anyone\'s feeling or make them ignore you, you can feel comfortable saying anything. I\'ve found it helps to ask questions in a non-judgmental tone and not to disagree with people right away, or make them feel like they\'re wrong. Maybe entertain the possibility that you could be wrong while you\'re speaking. But if you have something to contribute that someone else will appreciate, you should.\n\n""What were your thoughts on that news article saying MBTI was unscientific?"" > ""MBTI is full of shit.""\n\nI\'ve seen How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk\nand How To Win Friends and Influence People\nrecommended a lot, and I\'d recommend them too.', '@Rashe\nI know that I\'m upset about abything. I\'m posing the question whther lying is a necessary evil that we ENTPs must do in order to get what we want. Not in a manipulative way, but the changes in both ourselves and our surroundings. I guess I do feel a little ""upset"" that we must be almost ""a different type"" in order to function as OUR type to its full potential - ie making positive changes at work, making more compromises within relationships because we see/foresee stuff and know the other person will ""be"" a particular way, so we choose a different way in order to have harmony, synergy, etc. Its almost like, by the time we ENTPs finish maturing, we will no longer be ENTP, but opperate over multi-types for the good of mankind (sorry, that sounds a bit epic just can\'t be bothered to think of another way to put it right now).\n\nWith regards to what the news says...I don\'t watch the news. The news is for people who don\'t know how to find out stuff for themselves. They spoon-feed whatever will sell and promote discussion among the masses. Its a product after all which TV networks and newspapers all vying for your coin. It generally contains no investigative journalism anymore. Just my view. The whole world is full of bad shit, sad shit, and just shit We know that already. Good news appears to only come in the form of what\'s happening in sports and the lives of celebrities 99.9% of the time. That is not news for me. I know others will disagree and I\'m ok with that.', '', '', ""The news is an awful show and shouldn't be watched. But I feel like you just threw a red herring that doesn't really have to do with the point I was hoping to make.\n\nIs this post saying being passive aggressive and an asshole is a distinct part of what an ENTP is? And that not being an asshole is not being you?\nBecause that shouldn't be a problem for people that can communicate well."", 'why did I say ""lye""??? I\'m a freakin\' English teacher! must\'ve been really tired that night...:(\n', ""Dude your type isn't a mood but ignoring that I typically try to avoid lying not so much because it's wrong but because it's..umm.. see the thing is I like to manipulate people(F with their heads) just to see if I can for fun not evil and lying would just be breaking the rules(cheating) I have for myself so that I don't become a monster. Hard to say that without sounding like a sociopath...but meh.."", 'As a kid I lied a lot. When I was about 8 my Dad said ""doesn\'t lying stress you out"". He was right. Haven\'t since. For sure in a relationship there would be no point to lying because you wouldn\'t really have a relationship. And, most importantly, I don\'t need to lying. Saying the truth and simply not saying the truth works better. Truth is a very flexible concept.']","['Rationals', 'Personality', 'ENTP - Inventor']",ENTP - Inventor

I'm portuguese but I'm living in Switzerland so I searched for Switzerland but it doesn't appear, then I searched for Portugal but I couldn't find it either x)\nThere's no people here living in those two countries? I want to move anyway but yeah xD"", ""Hm... Never noticed those countries aren't available with the search function. It's probably based on popularity, though I'd contact the people who run the site (bottom right corner of the screen) to be sure.

If they don't exist that's probably because there's no people here from those countries, I don't know x)\nI guess I'll figure out where I want to move next and then I'll search based on that ahahah"", ""Ouuu finally a new forum post. Thanks Jessii! I'm surprised too there's no Portugal or Switzerland in there. There's even Pakistan in there?!! But Europe is so small you could look in any of the neighbouring countries.

251,300,narcissistic def. & idealization dynamic,"['I came across a concise definition of the narcissistic person and a short exposition on one aspect of its internal workings that I thought was worth sharing, book is ""The Borderline Personality: Visions and Healing"" by Nathan Schwartz-Salant.\n\n""In an earlier work I listed qualities of the narcissistic person (Schwartz-Salant, [Narcissism and Character Transformation], 1982, pp. 37ff.), including extreme self-absorption, lack of empathy, inability to accept criticism, and grandiose and exhibitionistic needs. Furthermore, the intense manner in which the psychic structures of the narcissistic patient affect the therapist through narcissistic transferences is notable and not difficult to recognize. [...]\n\nIt has been suggested that idealization plays a crucial role in the formation of the narcissistic person (Masterson [, The Narcissistic and Borderline Disorders] 1981, p. 13). According to this theory, the child has been the target of lofty and grandiose parental ideals. Through largely unconscious communications from parental figures he or she has been given the \'charge\' to fulfill unlived ambitions, which actually are the archaic forms of parental failures of individuation. It is clear that if the child is treated as \'special,\' difficulties will arise from so concentrated a form of attention, since the base requirement is to overachieve. But the matter is far worse. The narcissistic person has simultaneously been given a completely opposite message - namely, the devastating message of envy. This message is transmitted as follows: \'You are wonderful and I hate you for it. You have it all, and since I don\'t, I despise you for what I don\'t have.\' Here, having it all\' refers to more consciously idealized qualities espoused by the parents.\n\nThe narcissistic personality forms by using the received idealization, adapting to its values, [i]and[/i] creating an inner and outer barrier against the attack of envy. This barrier, called the narcissistic defense, makes for an oddly impenetrable personality. Tragically, the positive function of idealization is largely channeled into defensive patterns, and unless it is recovered through an interpersonal relationship in which idealization transmutes into an inner structure of ideals (Kohut [The Analysis of the Self] 1971), the potential of the narcissistic person is rarely achieved. When it does occur, this \'solution\' is the best of possible outcomes; more often, however, the narcissistic person surprises others by his or her [i]lack[/i] of success and is inclined to age badly and to cling to a past that all too clearly reveals its shallowness. In effect, remorse for unrealized potential becomes a major form of self-victimization, for such persons often become the proverbial \'jack of all trades and master of none.\'"" - pages 55-56\n\nP.S. The discussion about transmuting experiences into inner psychological structures and idealization in general related to the narcissistic personality is largely referencing the work of psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut and his school of Self Psychology. Cf. \'Object Relations Theories and Psychopathology: A Comprehensive Text\' by Frank Summers or the more focused (on Kohut\'s ideas) and introductory \'Treating the Self: Elements of Clinical Self Psychology\' by Ernest S.

252,301,Why are INTJs just the best?!,"[""Give your reason why you think being an INTJ is just the greatest thing in your life?II\n\nI'll start the ball rolling.\n\nBecause we are the Masterminds. We can outthink, outsmart, outwit anyone. We see a goal and with great skill and patience we persevere towards it until we reach it and grasp it. Long after others have given up, we steadily come closer and closer towards our goal until it becomes real. Our dream has then become our reality."", ""It really is fabulous being an NT because we're creative, intuative, deep and interesting without being clouded by emotions or subjective reality. Within the context of NTs, being an Introvert is advantageous because we don't have big mouths or feel the need to adhere to social convention unlike ENTJs, and being Judging is advantageous as we don't have our head in the clouds and can actually strategize and apply our intelligence and capabilities unlike INTPs."", ""No you cant 'outsmart' anyone. You are called the mastermind because you are more practical and organised than other rationals. Though the percentage of INTJs scoring in thentop 2% in IQ tests is the highest (37%) , followed by INTPs (20%) and INFJs (15%), I've read studies that indicate the very smartest of the smartest types are more often INTPs than INTJs. Curious that you think you'd outmart Einstein (INTP) for example. One in five INTPs have higher IQ than most INTJs.\n\nI admire INTJs for your motivation to put ideas into practise. You are the best at that. I scored INTJ once in a test by the way, though I usually score a weak P. I think INTPs and INTJs could learn a lot from each other. Together we make a perfect team."", ""Cannot possibly know INTJ is best until I have experienced what it's like to have the other 15 personality types but I'm guessing whatever personality I'd have would be my favourite when I have it. If I don't like myself why would anyone else?\nI do like having answers/solutions to everything, even if it's just the way to get to one."", ""@Danielintp2 Probably not the best 'romantic' team though. At least not for me. I couldn't have a healthy relationship with all that competition. Relationships are for mutual caring and nurturing, not fighting to see who's the 'smartest'."", 'Whatever personality type you are, you are stronger in one dimension than the other. I would find it more valuable to be better understand of each personality type or more balanced between personality dimensions. We all just gravitate toward different ideas, people, things. Variety is good for everyone!', '@danielintp - yes intps and intjs make one of the best teams that is possible. I know that from a couple intp friends of mine. We are on the same wavelength.\n\n@everyone - this is just a tongue in cheek thread, we are all gifted in different ways. But I just love being an INTJ MASTERMIND!!', ""I have INTJ-INTJ relationship, doesn't cause any extreme competition at all. We are intellectual equals and it is wonderful to be able to connect with someone on that level, as well as emotionally and physically, which is also very high level.

There can only be quantitative equivalence (1=1, 1 is equivalent to 1, etc.) and qualitative resemblance (object X shares a similitude in qualities with object Z).\n\nThere is no \'quantitative resemblance\' precisely because resemblance can only subsist within qualities: only qualities can permit resemblance. \'Qualitative equivalence\' can not exist because \'equivalency\' is best represented in quantitative terms: qualitative equivalency could only be vague and subjective.\n\n""Quality"" or ""Value"" as described by Philosopher Pirsig, cannot be defined because it empirically precedes any intellectual construction of it, namely due to the fact that quality (as Pirsig explicitly defines it) exists always as a perceptual experience before it is ever thought of descriptively or academically.\n\nPirsig is right. But besides being undefinable, quality as perceived through sense; is first and foremost an intensity. It is undefinable simply because it cannot be quantified.\n\nA quality (undefinable or not) does not have a physical body, but is virtually flowing from one location to the next in a center-less rhizomatic fashion.', 'That is precisely why I believe it is meaningless to filter qualitative differences via quantitative equivalencies\n\nE.g rating a movie out of 10 and then using it as a basis of comparison between movies to decide which is ""best"".

257,306,Simulation Transit Theory,"[""There have been thoughts for many years that our entire world could just be a computer simulation. There is even evidence being found to suggest that we are in a computer simulation.\n\nHowever I try not to focus on whether we are, or how to prove it, but instead think about why.\n\nWhy would someone create a computer simulation capable of simulating an entire universe and all life in it?\n\nSome have mentioned it's just a big video game, others some kids science fair project. I even had a theory where maybe it would be possible for an advanced species to plug all of a worlds life into said simulation so they can inhabit the planet without them having any knowledge of it.\n\nBut I think the best reason I've come up with so far is to transport over large distances. We do not currently have FTL travel. Warp drives aren't possible yet.\n\nSo, imagine 1000's of years from now. Let's say we continue on our path and destroy the earth. We have to move to a new planet, but the nearest planet is 100+ light years away. So it would take somewhere around 3.3 million years to get there at 20,000 MPH. In a best case scenario it would take 500,000+ years to get there.\n\nThen people have spent time researching how to get astronauts to survive a year+ trip through space in confined quarters.\n\nSome have suggested just transporting the DNA and growing human's when we get there. But DNA in the best frozen conditions only has a shelf life of 100,000 years or so, it likely would not survive the trip.\n\nSo I thought the perfect solution would be to create a computer simulation.\n\nSo imagine the earth is dieing (Interstellar (Movie) style), it's on it's last leg. So mankind builds many spaceships linked together quantumly with some form of quantum entanglement communication device. In total, maybe 1000's of space ships the size of football fields or larger.\n\nThese spaceships are capable of self repair, using asteroids, and self replication. Example they can dock on an asteroid, mine if for supplies and produce a new spaceship exactly like itself and stock it with human dna from it's parent ship.\n\nThe copy is plugged into the simulation via it's quantum link with the other ships and it just roams space.\n\nThere are people in every ship plugged into virtual earth. Generations live and die in transit through space with no idea it's even happening.\n\nEvery now and then a ship finds a habitable world. So it drops off some children to populate it and goes into an orbital monitoring mode. The space ship sticks around long enough for humans to get going on the planet (say 10,000 to 100,000) years, and once conditions have been met, it abandons it to it's fate and re-goes it's pursuit for a new world.\n\nSo the simulation could be nothing more than a DNA preservation system.""]","['General Topics', 'Spirituality & Philosophy']",Spirituality & Philosophy
258,307,INT* and Anxiety,"[""Hello all, I'm just curious what other INT*s experience with regards to anxiety, of all kinds.\n\nI didn't used to get anxious very much (besides social anxiety which for me is not very similar to what I would call general anxiety). Since I've turned 20 and especially just in the last year I've been getting anxiety in increasing amounts. Sometimes about something particular, sometimes about seemingly nothing. I had my first instance of what I would consider an anxiety attack during this past year, triggered by the feelings of utter hopelessness for my individual life that I have been feeling exponentially since around the time that high school began. I suspect that such stress has contributed to the development of this anxiety that I've started to get.\nIt's really starting to get out of hand where I'll feel like I'm unable to get enough air, like I can't sit still, my brain will race (sometimes with no actual content: I don't know how to really explain this but it's like some kind of machine that's intended to process something but it's empty and running on overdrive) for almost the entirety of a day, triggered by nothing in particular. Of course... When something specific does happen, it is MUCH worse.\n\nI recently was stung by a bee and for the first time had a mild allergic reaction (I've been stung about 5 times before in my life and it never really bothered me before; I always felt it wasn't a big deal and I remember other people telling me that I handled it surprisingly well compared to what they normally see as a reaction to a bee sting)... This of course lead to probably the worse anxiety attack I've had so far. Since none of them have felt the same to me, I didn't realize it was an anxiety attack and ended up going to the ER thinking that I was having a pretty serious allergic reaction. Of course they told me that it was ENTIRELY anxiety... but for the next week I had a very large rash covering my whole leg which has never happened before from a bee sting. (this is just one example of a specific occurrence which has resulted in extreme levels of anxiety, regardless of how directly the anxiety was tied to the occurrence)\n\nI find the fact that I'd have any kind of worse reaction mind boggling because I'm so obsessive about what I put into my body now compared to the past. I've never eaten very badly but now my diet is VERY healthy (largely based off of what I've read about indigenous cultures) and I can feel that it is healthier; my body operates a lot better than it was the few years before I made drastic changes in my diet (cutting out flours and refined sugars and trying to reduce processed foods to an absolute minimum; growing as much of my own vegetables as possible and eating only products from sources that don't use chemical and hormones; eating more saturated fats instead of sugars and cutting out polyunsaturated fats that have been exposed to heat; the only grain I eat now is brown rice, in whole form, not flour; trying to consistently eat wild caught fish)...\n\nanyway....\nI think that psychology is quite tied to many other things, of course I think everything is about exposure to conditions, so I wonder what other people with somewhat similar psychological mindsets experience in relation to overall physical functioning but particularly anxiety..\n\nI suppose this may be a pointless thing to wonder about because not many people seem to feel the way I do about life (I find it utterly depressing and horrific as of now considering the degeneration of our species and the ridiculous/seemingly endless limitations placed on all people by the dominant socioeconomic infrastructures that exist): even people who don't approve, as I do not, of the state of the world, don't often seem to be as consistently bothered by it. Basically, I suppose it makes sense that I would be having such extreme anxiety when I see no acceptable means of progressing in life and although I would like to not exist quite a lot, even killing myself would be settling for an option that is not good enough. I guess this topic is much more complex than just anxiety but it is one symptom that has been growing in the focus of my perspective recently...\n\nAs always, our language (a language which seems much better for art than for communication) is insufficient in inclusively expressing my situation and questions for others in relation to that situation... I suppose if I had more motivation to expend the effort required to do the best that I could, I may be able to expand on this more successfully but this is enough writing for now to be based only on simple curiosity despite the near-zero potential for it to result in any actually beneficial movement forward.\n\nFeel free to write anything you want about anything that's mentioned here, no need to stick strictly to the topic title.\n\n"", '""We simply are anxious, to our core, in the very basic make-up of our being.

That might trigger it. In that event that loud noise will ring in my ears and cascade into all other sounds in the building. Like my senses never recover from the shock. All the noise in the building starts to run together. Having a conversation with someone right next to me sounds like noise, I can't make out what they are saying. I can't understand the sounds around me. Visually colors bleed together, and it's like I'm tripping on some kind of hallucination drug. I can still seed, but everything looks weird. Things look stretched out, and start to spin.\n\nIt just keeps cascading into worse and worse effects, like a domino reaction.

I think it's generally good to isolate myself because it's not fair to other people for me to try and interact with them since I don't really like a lot of aspects of humans.. well that doesn't sound right.

The more enlightened you become, the more darkness you see in the world that needs to be illuminated.\n\nAnd there is only one of you.

There is only one of me... And that one only has the plan. Even if I could clone myself, who knows if said clone(s) would take the place of the implementer or not.\n\nI often wonder if I COULD adequately affect my environment without my incomprehensible failure to be sustainably social.. But sometimes I think I realize that it is a necessary symptom of the other 'understandings' that I have which possibly could be so implemented given an outward presentation that is functional in this reality (potential reality, of course)\nAt least I think I've finally moved fully beyond the delusion that the feeling is the problem."", ""As an INTP, we're thinkers.

I think I actually do have a lot of drive to get things done, it\'s more an issue of having no way to actually do it that is acceptable. If I was able to create an example community of Decentralized Open Source Producerism by operating inside the market economy, it would be incredibly less valid than the development of the same type of system without accepting my role as corruption fuel. To use money is to be another body assigning imaginary value to fiat currency and therefore indirectly assigning validity to the system that is currently in the process of removing most of the life, and its habitat, on Earth. It\'s somewhat related to the idea that the journey is the destination including the understanding that the destination is also the journey (continual emergence).\n\nSo the main limitation is finding a place on the surface of the earth to develop the system I envision without having to pay someone else to exist there... I\'ve located multiple geographic positions that would be ideal for such development with consideration for future climate instability but none of them are available to simply go to and start developing on.\nEven if they were, I have had no success so far finding people to go do that with and although I would still go start it without other people if I could, it would probably be a lot less individually stressful with other people and, eventually, other people would be absolutely necessary....\n\nSo... are there even people who won\'t just say ""well you\'re going to have to make money whether you want to or not lol"" and not understand that it isn\'t working I\'m opposed to but validating that system and interacting with the people who are totally okay with validating that fucking system.\n\nI mean.. also.. of course there\'s the issue of what I\'m doing right now which I feel endlessly guilty about from the time I wake up until falling asleep but I\'m looking at it more like.. even though at this point I\'m not strong enough to allow myself to discontinue any operation that even indirectly validates the worth of money and starve to death as I should, I refuse to further its validation by any amount...\n\nthere are too many variables to inclusively explain all of this\n\nbut.. it\'s not like I don\'t still try to find people to work with who might want to go to the land and just do it anyway in spite of the potential that all our work would be destroyed by the people who pretend that they own the land.

259,309,Do introverts really pair with extroverts?,"['I\'ve been focusing a lot of attention on the ""ideal"" match for an INTP lately, the ENFJ. Both in the abstract of reading about what their type is generally like and reading profiles of people that claim the type. I find myself wrapped in a mix of exhilaration and intrigue, but I wonder how long that would last before I was exhausted and needed to retreat to my own space.\n\nIn my experience, extroverts don\'t like when others around them re-zone themselves to a personal space. It doesn\'t make sense to them and they think something is wrong. It\'s similar to the manner that I will never be able to understand SF types. They don\'t see the world rationally and it pains me to try and follow their logic (or general lack thereof).\n\nWhen I am around other introverts, they have the same need for personal space and there\'s never a lack of understanding.\n\nIn what capacity do extroverts and introverts match up? Is it actually more compatible than introverts with introverts or extroverts with extroverts?', 'well, try a few and see, and then compare with how you feel around other people.', ""I've dated an ENFJ.. It's definitely fun. The reason why we had conflict was she'd try to make decisions based on feelings.. and I won't like that. INTPs don't want to make decisions easily, they'd love someone making little decisions for them. =)"", ""lol @RajanThakkar. Yeah on non personal stuff I do prefer other people making decisions if I don't have a preference. If someone knows me pretty well they'll know what I don't like so anything they suggest outside of that is fine."", ""@xilamne now I've commented I feel I should address your original post. yes introverts can pair well with extroverts if there's sufficient attraction, I think. No matter how much you need your own space, if you're genuinely and deeply attracted to someone you'll want to be with them too, they'll always be on your mind."", ""@xilamne now I've commented I feel I should address your original post too. yes introverts can pair well with extroverts if there's sufficient attraction. No matter how much you need your own space, if you're genuinely and deeply attracted to someone, you'll want to be with them too, they'll always be on your mind. I think those INTPs who need lots of space in a relationship are those ones that settled for people that they get on with rather than people that they feel a genuine pull towards."", 'I have only been with extroverts. Works well for me, what Cyanara said. I\'m an extreme introvert, but when I really like someone my personal space ""grows"" to include that person, so I don\'t feel drained from being with them. Also, it\'s nice to have someone who will do the talking for me when we travel or have to interact with other people.', ""ESFJ's sound perfect, as long as the generosity is in check.\n\nBasically I like to be with someone who is caring and generous, but not if it causes us to suffer. Like if I have to pay the mortgage 5 days late because we paid for someone's transmission in there car, or if I have to take my vacation from work because I was volunteered to help (her) help someone build a fence around their whole farm..."", ""I agree with Anju and Cyanara. I usually like a lot of alone time, but when I am in a relationship I don't mind giving up a lot of my alone time, at least in the beginning, to be with the other person. But l imagine, like Cyanara said, if I settled for someone I wouldn't want to give up as much of my alone time. Here is something I have thought about a lot recently: Do introverts like spending more time alone with their partners and extroverts like spending more time with their partners with other people around/in a group setting? If that is the case, I would much prefer an introvert because most of the time I don't prefer group settings or being around a lot of people."", ""I'm hesitant to claim any type as an ideal match (although I have heard that INTP and INFJ combinations are extremely rewarding and successful). I do believe any types can work, but you have to look at what you are looking for specifically. I am wary of an E because I do not want to get pressured into leaving if I don't want to. An I sounds ideal, as well as an N simply for communication.\n\nIf you want to get out more, then by all means find an E"", ""The most important part is that both have understanding of the other. Both sides will have natural conflicts in how they see the world and problems. They can either argue each others side as to what should be done.... or.... they can accept that each others opinions are valid and work together to ensure the best outcome for both parties.\n\nI's will often miss the social and experience aspects of an activity or path to solve a problem. E's can act without thinking things through to a rational conclusion. Both need to understand that each others way is valid and choose the best option instead of neither option because they cant agree.""]","['Rationals', 'INTP - Architect', 'Personality']",INTP - Architect
260,310,Best INTP Advice,"['http://www.intpexperience.com/Isolation.php\n\nI have spent months scanning through INTP forums, analyzing what we discuss, what we enjoy, which types we get along with, how to improve our lives, etc. However, the more information I collect, the more I question my typing and self-analysis (although I am clearly INTP). I have been caught in a vicious circle of trying to make sense of the similarities and variations within our type and, when I fail to piece together all the data, searching for the fault in my own logic. Nevertheless. I am determined to find the truth, and today I found something! These articles provide the most accurate and comprehensive understanding of our type, therefore I highly recommend it to INTPs!', ""It's part of the INTP personality to do that :). It's like a catch 22 with our personality. The fact that we do that is what makes us INTP's lol.\n\nMyself wise, I analyse everything, over analyze, and analyze again. And no matter how many times I come up with an understanding of something, I analyze it again and again in case I was wrong. Or I analyze it on different days with different input criteria to make sure I come to the same understanding.\n\nIf I write a short story, I write 30 versions of it and ask someone which one they like best..\n\nWhen I write computer code, I rewrite what I did yesterday because I thought of a better more efficient way to write it that night while trying to sleep.\n\nI look at the whole world as if everything in it is wrong, and figure out how to make it better. But even that is wrong, because everything can always be better than it currently is.\n\nIt's a never ending cycle with no termination. E.g. Nothing is ever done, only better than it was yesterday.\n\nPersonally, though I believe that INTP's and like types are what drive innovation and advancements in the world. If everyone was ok with how something is and wasn't trying to fix it we would still be swinging in trees."", ""I am still reading through it, but even with the pieces I have already read I can tell this article is wonderful. Thank you very much for sharing this find.\n\nAlso, the (dangerous) method I use to break the cycle of over analysis is understanding that I'm correct most of the time, so there isn't as much of a need for re-examination of all the data. To put it simply, I stop second-guessing my own conclusions. This ideology has its own faults, but it keeps me from going around with cyclical thoughts all day and night.""]","['Rationals', 'INTP - Architect', 'Personality']",INTP - Architect

262,312,How do I find a match? INFJ...,"[""Internet dating just doesn't feel right. Waiting for the universe to strike seems to require infinite patience. I don't want to waste my time on anyone who isn't close to &quot;just right&quot; - serial dating sounds horridly uncomfortable (and as a single mom of four, time is at a premium). I also don't feel comfortable just casting a wide net and seeing what I catch; at my age, I don't have time to waste on most of what would turn up. And I am still gunshy from the ending of a very-long-term relationship (19 years; ended over 4 years ago) and am hesitant to risk my heart again. But I crave emotional intimacy and am feeling rather desperate to find a way to get that need filled - but not so desperate that I lose sight of my boundaries. Still feeling protective of my heart.\n\nMy ex was a T (INTP), and I don't think I could ever have an iota of patience for a T again. My eldest teen is also a T, and I'm sick to death of having my feelings rationalized away. Can't go there again. How to find a good match who is not a T?\n\nWith INFJs being 1-2% of the population, how the heck do you connect with each other IRL?\n\nI read that INFJs are often not proactive about reaching out to begin relationships. Are we all doomed to singledom? ;-)\n\nWould love some insights on this from other INFJs. Where do you lurk???"", ""I am not sure if my comment is welcome. But I think trying to understand other types and their perspectives might help. At least with making us less annoying. If you restrict your options to INFJs, then combined with the reluctance to reach out to each other, the very small proportion of INFJs overall, and the fact that other INFJs are also be going to be looking at you with the same skepticism...well, I don't need to tell you the rest. Also just because another person is an INFJ, or an NF, doesn't mean you will get along. They might not appreciate the woman that you are, or the mother that you are, or the person that you are. And without that understanding, your emotions might clash. They might see the world the same way you do, but they might not see you, or the relationship, they way you want them to.\n\nI do understand why you wouldn't want to date an INTP. I used to think most INTPs were like me, but more of the males do seem to be at the more extreme end of the T scale, and not in a sexy way.

268,319,Reverse engineering relationships,"[""We, as humans, have an overwhelming tendency of doing everything wrong. We swim against the current and become exhausted or we let the current take us out to sea and we struggle to stay afloat. If you are having issues finding a relationship or the 'right one' or aren't as happy as you could be, it's because you're doing it wrong. And that's fine because you are part of the 99% who are doing the same.\n\nTo explain: We as humans have egos. Many of us have come to believe we are special, we are good, we deserve happiness and there is at least one special person out there for us. That's BS we keep telling ourselves and our single friends to keep them from sinking into an emotional pity-party quagmire they might not come out of. So, we cling to hope. We date out of desperation or conviction that the special person is out there. We struggle with bad relationships or lack of chemistry. So here's what we're doing wrong:\n\nWe seek what we want and ignore what we need. Desire, loneliness and desire makes us stupid.\n\nHow familiar does this sound: 'I'm looking for someone who is funny and can make me smile, is outgoing, confident, intelligent, sexy, sweet and caring, calm, honest. Someone that likes the same things I do and I can spend time with enjoying ourselves.'\n\nThis is quite close to an impossibility. What you are looking for is an EISNFTPJ. Someone who is outgoing but not overbearing, confident but not narcicistic. Sensitive but firm. Organized but spontaneous. You want the ideal person...and they pretty much don't exist. Even if they did....they're also looking for that perfect person and not you, no matter how much you think you might be that.\n\nHere's the problem.... you want what suits your personality but you need the opposite. This is an issue. A big one. You expect too much of one person. The answer then, is to have many, not just one. To explain and to keep this simpler than it is:\n\nPeople who you enjoy spending time with because they like the same things you do are called friends or aquiantences. You want them in your life to socialize with and share like-minded thoughts and activities...to do the things you find fun. They are somewhat like you in that you think in similar ways and view the world in similar ways. You enjoy being with them. Sounds ideal, right?\n\nYou will find yourself unfulfilled by a relationship with your best friend. This is because you are dating yourself. You will live together quite well and make good roomates. You will not be attracted to them for the right reasons, however. You will have fun and feel good about them until you get on each others nerves. This will happen because you are both missing what you need....someone who is not like you.\n\nWhat you need, is what you are not. Those that have the qualities you do not possess, A view on the world and a way of thinking and feeling and interpreting that you lack. However content you may be with living with your mirror, you will always be drawn and attracted to that which is different...exotic. Mysterious in that you do not quite understand them. They will drive you mad with their different ideas and ideals, make you grit your teeth with the nonsensical discussions you have and in the end will inflame your passions like none other. You will love to hate them or hate to love them but in either case, they make you feel. Real, deep feeling.\n\nYour opposite makes you whole. You make them whole. For all their flaws, you compensate and bring to them your answers. They compensate in those areas you are lacking. You will not likely agree on what to watch on TV and have heated arguments.....and amazing makeup sex.\n\nThe part you are missing most and doing wrong in looking for a relationship is that you want someone who is better left as a friend and you need someone who completes you as a person and drives you.\n\n- Have your friends. Never forsake them because they keep you grounded.\n- Rid yourself of your idea of an ideal mate. They do not exist and you will end up making your relationships in to that person, only to be disappointed.\n- Seek out those who are completely different than you. Those are the droids you are looking for.\n\nLastly....be open-minded. Do not choose to despise people because they are different than you, think differently and or act differently. Cheirsh their individuality when compared to your own. Appreciate their strengths and see each difference as an advantage to you both as a whole. Also...enjoy the clawing, sheet-clenching, almost violent 'I hate you - I love you' sex. Most people don't get that because their too busy doing their best friends and imaginig they were with their opposites instead.\n\n\n\n"", 'Interesting read. But opposites do not always attract. Especially when it comes to issues relating to religion and politics. However liked a lot what you raised about ""what they/us want"".\n\nWhat I do not understand about many females describing their ideal partner in their profiles, are things like ""make me laugh"", ambition, loyalty, and so on.\n\nMake you laugh? I am not a clown. I do not expect you to be my clown. And laugh at what? Find what type of thing humorous? Youtube videos of people fails that usually result in some kind of physical (and often painful) injury? Slapstick vines? Surreal humour, Monty Python style? British humour, \'allo \'allo style?

Do you want me to come home late at night, spending extra time in the office chasing promotions, chasing money, or be out ""networking"" (god, hate that term and concept), working hard on my professional life, ignoring my personal life?\n\nJust where do you fit into this desire for me to be ambitious?\n\nLoyalty and trust? What else can love be built on!? This is PART of what love is. It is not something in addition to love, like ketchup on a hotdog.\n\nDo not over analyse your profile? Not a realistic expectation for an INTJ type.\n\nRather tell me about YOU as a person, then what you expect me to be. Tell me what makes you laugh, instead of telling me, that you expect me to be your clown. Or whatever.\n\nShare some of yourself. Not your expectations.', '\'Interesting read. But opposites do not always attract. Especially when it comes to issues relating to religion and politics. \'\n\nTrue enough. There is something to e said about compromise though. Just like we hope that the political left and right would reach across the isle to get things done and the religious would just live and let live.\n\nFor making them laugh...they\'re more in tune with their emotions. They want to feel good more than anything. Laughter is a symbol of joy and its the joy they want to experience. Think about picking her up in your arms and twirling her around, to her delight and inevitable smile and likely laughter. It\'s joy they want, not a jester. If your quick wit is appreciated on a level that it brings her joy...that\'s what she\'s looking for.\n\n\'Ambition? Why? Do you want me to come home late at night, spending extra time in the office chasing promotions, chasing money, or be out ""networking"" (god, hate that term and concept), working hard on my professional life, ignoring my personal life?\'\n\nIn a nutshell, yes. This is what she wants. But she\'ll want your personal time too. Yeah....it\'s a thing.\n\nTrust and loyalty...depends on viewpoint and the connotations of the word. They both can be intrinsic and byproducts of love. Still, there are many couples with open relationships or polygamy that aren\'t necessarily \'loyal\'. I think love can exist without trust but it won\'t last without it.\n\nMy take on things anyway,. I think that most people only aim for what they want and not what they need...and they\'re rather clueless on what they actually need.', 'Cannot compromise on fundamentals like religion and politics - it will burn you at some stage in the future. Personal experience.\n\nLove needs to be beyond the mere physical in my view. I cannot respect views that for example supports pseudo sciences (like the ex that made me an appointment with a homoeopath after getting tendonitis from doing heavy weights in the gym). How do you confront that type of thing in a relationship? When basic beliefs are at stake?\n\nSo there need to be a basic set of similar beliefs for a foundation to exist in the relationship.\n', ""I suppose it would depend on the individual. If you're a person who cannot be with someone that thinks and believes differently than you, then certainly. It's a big deal. However, some believe that something is only a big deal if you make it a big deal.

To each their own."", 'I don\'t think I do not have an open mind (cannot claim to speak for all INTJs). And one of the greatest gifts a person can give me is to prove me wrong using logic, facts, reason and evidence. As I will get to learn something totally new that I did not know, or was wrong about.\n\nUnfortunately most arguments I encounter use emotional logic, and present opinion as fact and evidence. And if these are the best a person has to offer, that person will not change my mind.\n\nFor example, don\'t even try to argue that astrology is real. There is no evidence that the positions of planets and stars can influence in any way, lives (and the future) of people on earth. There is simply no evidence. No logic. No rational. Fact - astrology is fake. So say astronomy. So say quantum mechanics. So say the Standard Model. So say all of science.\n\nAnd this is where the incompatibilities between people impact their relationships. For example, how can I respect my partner if she sincerely believes in astrology? A relationship needs to be intellectual too. It cannot only depend on the chemistry of physical attraction.\n\nWhere I do agree with your posting is that if you are introverted, it does not mean your partner needs to be introverted too. It is dealing with, and loving these differences, that expand our comfort zones, make us grow - and realise that there are (quoting John Legend) ""perfect imperfections"".', ""I see where you're coming from on the Astrology thing. You did mention though religion and politics. Religion can come down to Science vs Faith and I could see you holding firm on it, especially an INTJ. Have to figure something like that is pretty central for you, though correct me if I'm reaching a bit on that.\n\nBut lets put it a bit closer to home. What if they had their own scientific theories that differed from your own? Say, they had argued against the existence of the Higgs before the recent discoveries...something that wasn't yet scientific fact but theory. Would you still be uncompromising if you were adamant the Higgs existed? Would something like that be enough to dissuade you from having a relationship with them?\n\nHow about Politics? Little in the way of concrete facts. More, ultra-simplified, different ways of tackling the same problem. There's arguments on both sides that are compelling the political topics under the sun. Would it keep you from experiencing love and companionship because you believe in spending your way out of a recession instead of being more fiscally conservative?\n"", ""Fascinating. I've have my flares with several ISFJs. Strange relationships indeed. Communication is difficult but they tend to be great in the long run, but so far they have merely petered out or blown out.

Get some feedback.\n\nT's, need Fs and vice-versa.\n\nStrong statement I know and maybe counter-intuitive for us INTPs. Fs cause us so much confusion and concern. Feeling for their answers instead of logic. However, I put it this way:\n\nLogic provides us with what is the correct answer.\nEmotion provides us with what is the right answer.\n\nFor a definition of the two terms, correct is what is logically sound. Right is what is morally sound. The best answers to a solution are both what is correct and what is right at the same time. Not all choices are as clear-cut however.\n\nDue to not exercising our emotional selves, we are, basically, emotionally retarded in the literal sense. It's still a volcano of emotion in there but it scares us and doesn't make any sense so we lock it up. Feeling types are something of the opposite...life is dark and cruel and cold without emotion and thinking purely logically is like seeing the world as black and white instead of being in full color.\n\nWhile we may come to long-thought out and adamant conclusions about a course of action, we may not be taking some of the emotional or social peculiarities that we do not understand into account. Using a knife to kill someone is cheaper than using a gun and we could find the least expensive financial, logical option to the problem. Our counterparts would argue that we should not kill anyone due to repercussions of the victims family and the morale blackness of such an action. It's an extreme example but it is a just one: we may not have all the variables to determine what is 'right'. The Feeling types may not have the variables and logic that we have to determine that their action is incorrect.\n\nThus, while we may not understand how they come to conclusions, we should appreciate their experience in areas we lack, namely emotional and social connection to other humans. Appreciate their emotional intelligence. If this happens, they can learn to appreciate our own logical and rational perspectives once we have validated theirs and they feel appreciated (they love that...a Feeling thing).\n\nWhat do you think?"", 'The situation is not so much a war with feelers, but a war within ourselves. INTPs repress their inferior feeling function like an unwanted stepchild, and when that child emerges, they lose all control over it. The issue is caused by self-denial. Logic for instance, does not tell us what is true. It can only tell us when two things cannot be simultaneously true. INTPs value objectivity so much that they will deny fundamental elements of their humanity in order to ascend to a godlike perspective. The one virtue becomes so elevated at the expense of a corresponding, equally necessary virtue, that when this arrangement is discovered to be unsustainable, the Jekyll and Hyde paradigm becomes particularly prominent.

You nail it!', 'Bang on.', "">Logic provides us with what is the correct answer.\nEmotion provides us with what is the right answer.\n\nYo, brilliant sentiments.\n\n>Due to not exercising our emotional selves, we are, basically, emotionally retarded in the literal sense. It's still a volcano of emotion in there but it scares us and doesn't make any sense so we lock it up. Feeling types are something of the opposite...life is dark and cruel and cold without emotion and thinking purely logically is like seeing the world as black and white instead of being in full color.\n\nWhat if a child of the MBTI is half-Thoughts, half-Flowery feelings? xD Assuming the possibility of an underdeveloped race between the functions, or an equal output of thinking or feeling, who might work as a good friend/mate? Should those folks find another hybrid or choose based on preference?"", ""Well, it's still a bit of a sliding scale. We joke about INTPs not having emotions, being the borg. We have emotions and tons of them. We keep them locked up. That is not to say we don't think with our hearts sometimes. We're just skewed to one side of logic vs feeling. Some of us are further along the slider than others.\n\nI tested heavy IN, strong T but marginal P. From what I've seen I'm a bit more in touch with my emotions that some other INTPs or INTJs. Also I find that in order to function well, some of the things I do needs to be structured and some monotonous, continuous activities without change...pure repetition, gives me time to daydream and think.\n\nI think you can be closer to the middle.

Ready, Set, TYPE!!!!"", ""Well I guess a mix between Bell and Mulan like those so much equally I can't decide.\n"", ""I would have to say either Mulan, Pocahontas, Rapunzel, or Merida.

Also....I had a rather strong crush on Ariel growing up."", 'Redheads are just so damn sexy.', 'Wait, I think avemaria wants to discuss the MBTI types of princesses.

Nestoravila - i think Belle is for sure an infp but mulan? I feel like mulan is more of an isfj being so loyal', ""So... I'm Owl from Winnie the Pooh..."", 'Well I only said Mulan because I also related to the FJ functions as I always test with only a difference of about 2% between INFJ and INFP so it just seemed like Mulan might have started of as an FP at the start of the film although oppressed at the time do to the social norms of the time and as the movie progressed she was sort of forced into this FJ persona. Only reason why I was in a mix between Mulan and bell and sure not totally related to MBTI but it was just Mulan and how she was raised that I found relatable :-p', 'Sleeping Beauty, so ESFP, especially the version in Shrek :D\nCinderella, ISFJ.', 'i definitely agree cinderella is an isfj and thats an interesting analysis of mulan', ""I've always hated Cinderella.

271,322,Where did all the good x go?,"[""Hi.\nWe're right where we've always been. Waiting to be found, minding our own business and dodging the crazy/clingy/damaged people that would eat us for breakfast and drain the life and will to live from our souls.\n\nWe play social dodgeball, trying not to end up on the floor and wondering what just hit us.\n\nWe do not go to clubs to look for love. We hang out in coffee houses, the library or in the park.\n\nWhile we may desire love, (most of us) are not willing to sell our souls for it.\n\nWho are we? We're the people you choose not to see everyday. The normal, the average. The invisible and the hidden. Those you've turned your nose up on in school or made the be inferior.\n\nYou want to know where all the good people have gone? You've ignored them your whole life. You've driven them away with your special brand of ignorance. Those that may have loved you without condition you've deemed insignificant. *YOU* did this.\n\nNow we've learned to survive and be without you. We've adapted in our solitude. You've had your time, settled down with the aggressives, the confidents, the rich or are still looking for one. You've come to realize how much of a jerk they all are and now time is growing shorter for you. And you wonder, 'where have all the good _____ gone?'.\n\nWe're still here. Finding our own joys in life and experiencing and observing it. And you. Now it's our turn to smile and turn from you and the desperate whining about how people have changed and how you cannot find anyone nice.\n\nHi. We're still here, but not for you. We huddle together with the other nice people in places like this, far from your gaze.\n\nWe can only hope for your own sake, safety or piece of mind that someday before your best days are behind you and it is too late that you realize the error of your ways.\n\nGood luck on your search out there. We'll be here, where we've always been."", ""Story of my life, I think INTP's must have this in common :("", ""what makes you think we're not the crazy/clingy/damaged people :)? crazy is in the eyes of the beholder."", ""You have me laughing now. That's an excellent point. I wonder...sometimes a lot, if I'm the screwed up one. When you go against convention so often, it's hard to know if everyone else is doing it wrong, or if we're just missing the point."", ""Well, to be honest this post seems like another version of how the 'nice guys' rant about women going after jerks. I do understand that the context is different; I just mean to say that it has the same passive-aggressive tone to it."", ""Quite astute of you then. After a good reread, I agree.

273,324,INTP ideal match,"[""I have an idea\nI think ISFJs are the best match, or one of the best matches, for an INTP\nthis never gets mentioned in type dynamics, because all the focus is on shared intution, or shared feeling, but I think (albeit in rational way) that the type you're the best mached with is the one that causes you the least stress and gives you the most reward. Or to put it in an economic way, the type match that gives the most 'satisfaction' for the least 'cost'."", ""Most satisfaction for the least cost would be another INTP. Cost would be next to nothing. What an ISFJ or ESFJ provide is a maximum of satisfaction at a possible heavy cost. Someone that does not think they way you do, does not see things the way you do and fundamentally disagrees with everything that is you is a tough nut to crack. If the two can compliment each other instead of combat each other, it's the best possible outcome. But you really need to understand the dynamic.\n\nIn other forums, INTPs list ESFJ/ISFJ as their mortal enemies and the least favorite people."", ""I knew someone would say that, that the INTP-INTP is more ideal. It definitely wins on the cost front, but I don't think it provides the satisfaction to tip the scale. It's basically a nothing, you're no better off, or worse off, with another INTP.\n\nLol I didn't realise INTPs consider SFJs mortal enemies. Are you sure it was ESFJ/ISFJ and not ESTJ/ISTJ?\n\nOh and strangely enough, though three of the type letters are different, ISFJs have all the same functions as INTPs. So we may not think as differently as you might, think.\n\n\nActually that's probably a mean thing to say, about INTPs. Of course it wouldn't be a ;nothing', as two different people would always bring different things to the table. But I feel a typical INTP paired with me, wouldn't be that much different from being by myself, except I would have somebody else to be 'by myself' with."", 'I find INTJ types the most attractive. NT is a need for me.. entj can make me nervous.', ""It was ESFJ. I went on a small campaign to show that it was a good match and the results were either 'I can't stand em' and 'I married one'. Nothing in between.\n\nI wasn't aware of the ISFJ having the same functions. I'll have to look into that.\n\nAs I was saying in another rather long-winded previous post, I think we should have NTP friends and SFJ lovers. Asking for everything in one package is really tough to find. Someone that compliments you and 'gets' you is tricky.\n\nI didn't realize it until awhile ago but my wife, initially, was an ESFJ. At least on the outside. She was everything I wasn't...outgoing, grounded, emotionally expressive, sexually aggressive and organized. All these traits attracted me to her. I was quiet, shy, thougtful, smart, witty, intelligent and calm. She was attracted to those things, so we hit it off.\n\nIn my efforts to show my affection, I offered to help do things like clean and cook. Do my fair share. Small symbols...our way, I think. Over time, she grew to enjoy these things and started doing less and less. She started becoming more like me....more introverted, went out less. Started relying on me more for organization, paying the bills on time, etc. Yet, she still demanded affection and sex.\n\nNow, I never married her for her looks. She's pretty enough but I wasn't sexually attracted to her. She was my best friend and I could see us growing old together. As things progressed towards her becoming an ISFP, I was less and less attracted to her and more and more frustrated at not being functionally INTP anymore. Over the years, things have come to a head a few times and we've eventually agreed to separate. I've been the worst thing for her.\n\nMorale of the story: It comes down to what you determine you are looking for most in a person. My wife never understood me or took any interest in my own interests but that wasn't what I was looking for in her. What I was looking for, faded. I think if know what your looking for, it could come from different types. If you value most being understood, you'll want someone similar to your own personality. If you want someone exciting and interesting, you'll want the opposite of your type.\n\nWhat's most important to you?"", 'hmmmmm\nok scrap the whole idea. lol', ""People in my own type group are interesting and exciting due to conversations. I want a friend in my lover, so while I'm in a relationship with a ESTJ.... I find I don't get along with S types. F ax opposed to T can annoy me. Either an understanding extrovert, or intovert. P or J doesn't matter much for me. I notice the fictional characters and certain people I 'crush' on are usually INTJ. It gives me a challenge I think. Plus keeps me interested, who doesn't like mystery.\nESTJ types for me are too manipulative, cranky, and bossy.\nI go more with birds of a feather flock together. Our personalities may be simiilar, but our interests may barely overlap. I like art, INTJ seems to like technology.\n\nAnyone else get chafed by the sentinel/executive group? ST types. S vs N I think can be difficult.\nI think match two letters at least, try for 3 but 4 can cause problems as you don't compliment each other.\nMy thoughts are close to http://www.massmatch.com/MBTI-2.php"", ""I think according to socionics it is one of the ideal matches but I'm not completely sure. I know that an ENTJ is the best match for myself, an ISFP, then closely followed by an INTJ. So going by that, it seems they would"", ""Crunchtime that's a really good way of looking at it. I'll keep that in mind. My thought about ISFJ was instinctive. I find when I use instinct it often turns out more accurate than if I analyse. So I use analysis for verification. It might not really be pure instinct but just a culmination of experiences and observation.\n\nThe very first thing I read about ideal matches in MBTI was about the N/S thing. That having shared N or shared S is the key to long term success in relationships. Which sounds great in theory. But I've found that in reality most Ns are too, 'N', for me to be close with them. It just gets too much, because it's like my N, and their N, and it's just this big growing snowball of N with no end in site (i.e. a reality check).\n\nLike I've noticed on this site when I post things about general life nobody responds. Like come ooooon doesn't anybody listen to music, or watch films, or watch TV, or anything..?\n\nI find I can be myself more easily with Ss because I'm not under this 'N microscope'. I guess the whole thinking, intuitive loop is not something I seek outside of myself at least not to a huge extent. I like to talk about theories but at some point I'll just crack a joke, like, enough already. When I'm with people I don't wish to be eeeven more lost in thought, or eeeven more analytical, or eeeven more philosophical.. I just want to chill. I don't want to be smart, or debate, or contemplate the mysteries of the universe. I want to laugh, and chat, and talk about, stuff.\n\nBut specifically to do with the ISFJ thing, I have an ISFJ close friend, and she drives me absolutely nuts sometimes, but I've grown more and more fond of her and I would never have predicted this when I first met her, that out of all the people I knew she would turn out to be the one I am fondest of. And I think it's that ISFJ combination, it's not like other SJs. Yes there's the critical, scheduling, controlling side, but it is completely overshadowed by the caring, protective side. ISFJs first and foremost want everyone to be ok and everything to be ok. If you're with them they want to make sure that you're warm, that you're not hungry, that you're happy with whatever the situation is. I never feel neglected or ignored with her. Ever. And also I've learnt so much about being a more caring person from her. I've basically learnt how to love. And it's because with her I don't have to worry, I know she'll show up, I know she'll do whatever she says she'll do, I know she'll be on time, I know she won't forget. I know she'll always opt to do the thing that makes both of us happy not just her. She's available in all the ways that count, and that makes me feel safe. And that feeling allows me to access deeper emotions which strengthens the bond. So it's like a positive reinforcing loop. She does more and more things, I trust her more and more, I feel safer and safer, I open up more and more, she opens up to me, I feel she trusts me, etc.\n\nSo maybe it's just me that ISFJs are good for :)."", 'All I know is a particular estj..... jealousy, paramoia, cheated recently, liar, and very controlling. Also the i/e is a problem... possibly just the person too', 'But I said ISFJs! not ESTJs or ESFJs. Why is everybody lumping SJs into one box?', ""By the way WickenKittenLove you were too fast, I was still in the editing phase. :)\n\n\nAlso I know what you mean about the 'chafing' with STs. Oo-hoo-hoo-hoo.. they really get on my nerves. I don't know any ISTPs closely, but ISTJS, ESTJs, they're difficult. It'slike all the worst things in one, too realistic, too objective, too controlling, too conformist."", 'Li', 'That does sound very difficult. The age thing, almost becomes a bigger issue than the type. You need someone who will let you, be.', ""While I love her qndncare, I don't think I can forgive her. We have been together four years....\nI'm also dealing with her anger and depression, she may be bipolar."", 'sounds a little bit to me like part of what makes it even more difficult for you is holding too much in. maybe consider letting it out more, your emotions, like saying how you feel when you feel it, and try not to feel too embarassed when you do.', ""When you split, always cut the cord. Completely. No second chances, no 'lets be friends', none of that. You give it at least a year with no contact to let all the feelings die. We are too easily manipulated when someone has roots in our heartstrings.\n\nStick to your guns and believe....someone else will love you again. We're horrible for thinking that we won't be."", ""@Cyanara; Everyone has their benefits and detractions. For opposite types, these are both magnified by a power of two. What we like about them, we *really* like about them and fits us perfectly. When we don't like about them drives us bat-shit.\n\nIt's up to each to determine if they will enjoy the other for what they bring to the table, or shun them for being different. Luckily for us, our opposites are generally a happy, positive sort."", 'Mhm. Thank you Crunchtime. I just fear the explosion', ""Trick with explosions: don't be around them."", ""@Crunchtime that is so true. I find I do have to remind myself sometimes why I love my ISFJ friend. But the thing is, it doesn't last, because she never says anything or does anything that hurts so deeply that I still remember it more than a day or a few days after. But I've had things said to me or done to me by other types that I still remember for yeeeears after, because it hurt so bad. It might just be her, not just her type, but I take it as a good indication of what a relationship with a healthy ISFJ would be like."", ""And I think, in relationships, status quo does not lead to ultimate satisfaction, even for us passive INTPs. You do need to get really angry, or really emotional every once in a while. It's about how you handle it and come back from that to a neutral state, that's what determines the health of a relationship or how good a match you are. Not whether you annoy each other, but how you act towards each other after you annoy each other."", 'Exactly! ""Not whether you annoy each other, but how you act towards each other after you annoy each other. ""\n\n', 'I believe that ENFX types are the way to go for INTP.

274,325,Geeks can make the best lovers,"[""Yeah, I said it. I originally posted 'Geeks make the best lovers'.. no 'can'. I do believe it. Most geeks or nerds or whatever society has chosen to call us introverts with big minds and hearts are really a missed opportunity. The reason I say 'can' in the title is it would be dependent if the introvert cares about or not.\n\nHere's some advantages we have:\n- We read. We study. If the opposite sex is our topic, we'll study the hell out of it.\n- If *you* are our topic, we'll study the hell out of you. What makes you laugh, what makes you cry. What turns you on. What makes your toes curl. The exact, precise way you like to be touched. Your each and every button you have.\n- They've likely not had many relationships which makes you *special*.\n- Introverts treat their special people very well.\n- We can know how to do it, we're just not experienced. We don't come with bad habits.\n- If you can make it into an introverts heart, you will be adored.\n\nThe one area we may be lacking in, especially the Ts, is we may not exude passion. However, once you're 'in' with an introvert and they are comfortable with opening up to you without fear, look out. Caged tigers.\n\nIn the end, you can have someone that is a *very* attentive and knowledgeable lover, someone who is more than willing to experiment and has an inner fire that can rock your world unlike any other."", ""Ya know you're right... What else they gonna think about at home in their geeky room all alone. Lol playin"", ""I know you're playin, that's cool. On a side note....we as people tend to be handicapped in one area and gifted in another. For a lot of us, our handicap is social graces.

I really do study the opposite sex ( gender ) a lot.', ""Ns especially....we watch and theroize and study more than actually do. We learn, we figure things out. Take peoples bad encounters and understand why they were bad, search out and study the best approaches to affection, love and sex. It's funny...the actual act is more like data for us.

I understand that is something uncommon for INTJ people, but for myself, the evidence I've seen in science and ethics points to no other option but a creating entity. After that, I chose Christianity as it best fits my morals and makes the most sense given the evidence.\n\nNot looking to try and debate this out, just curious."", ""I've seen several facebook groups for INTJ christians; they're not that rare."", 'Interesting topic for a Sunday I guess. I was ""introduced"" to Church attendance as a teenager after someone took me along. The story of salvation and structure of life in church was really meaningful in my life for many years. Not surprisingly given my INTJ credentials, I struggled most with the social aspect of Church life most and had a tendency to be judgemental of ""leaders"" whom others seemed to blindly follow despite obvious flaws in teaching and living that harmed others and the reputation of the Church... yet the crowd just seemed to love the status quo and a ""greedy Gospel"". I no longer attend services and cannot see myself doing so again and feel a little sad at that if I am honest.', ""I can understand that. I've been in some churches like that, and I usually end up having to just find a new church after that. Like any religion, there are bad apples."", 'My boss is INTJ and religious', 'im an INTJ who has faith in God. im not religious. i think religion has merit and used properly can bring a lot of light to areas where ppl dont know or understand, but want to. but theres a major investment of self necessary, and you know mankind is great for trying to cut corners.\n\nmy relationship is with God, and that spills out into my interaction with other people. not the other way around. religion (most, as i see it) seeks to stand in between or even take Gods place. on that note, to answer your post, i am not religious, with an asterisk.\n\njust throwing this out there, pop culture, news, media. ""society"" as people recognize it are all forms of religion imo. but thats probably a way diff topic altogether.\n', 'I see. Personally, I\'ve always seen religion as more of the rule structure. It can certainly be destructive to its own interests, but I\'ve also seen the benefits as it keeps at least my faith in particular from morphing into a group obsessed with cultural relevancy over the actual tennants of the belief. I certainly understand why many people reject ""religion"", but I\'ve always seen it as something that needed to be fixed, not abandoned.', 'i like that point. i really like that point. as expected of a fellow INTJ. ""fixed, not abandoned"" well said.', 'I believe in science = scientific miracles in Quran = islam = one god', ""Yeah. There really isn't a solid argument against God.\nOnly emotive ploys and ad hominems.\nMuch more evidence for.\nA more pertinent question is whether the universe simply is God or whether the same is a personal deity (or many).\nAlso, people often forget that the underlay of mechanics is energic and disparate; though perhaps not in the exact sense that many presume.\nNewtonian perspectiveboundness.\nThere is one god and also many gods.\nMuch Theology is semantics at the outset.\nOnce terms and something of schema are agreed things get more malleable, in a more definite sense, that is to say."", 'I think our personality type more than any other drives us to seek and understand the highest forms of truth. Faith & spirituality fall squarely in this domain so its quite logical that INTJs should spend a disproportionately large amount of time investigating the subject. The outcome ofcourse will vary from person to person but I would imagine an INTJ to end up with a strong opinion one way or another. I for one am a believer.\n', 'I agree with June1 about INTJs giving it some consideration to it and having strong opinions about it. I frequent INTJforum. There are times when I\'m inspired to get involved in their religion/mythology section (which is hidden from view unless you have over 80 posts on that board). It looks like about a quarter of the INTJs there are believers in one faith or another.\n\nI personally treat the whole thing as a purely scientific matter.\n1)We are ultimately talking about the structure of the universe.\n2)The properties of the universe are the only authority; accuracy exists if, and only if, it perfectly aligns with what Mother Nature says.\n3)Humans tend toward fancy when dealing with these matters so it\'s best not to pay attention to them when making determinations about the structure of the universe.\n4)The properties of the universe say nothing about the presence of deity. (The only place I\'ve ever seen it hinted at was in the beliefs of believers.)\n5)You probably saw ""I\'m solidly atheist"" coming.', ""I'm not religious. But by that, I mean that I don't actually believe in any specific entity. However, I do participate in weekly Christian church organizations and I use those experiences to better my own morals. But at the current time, I have more evidence swaying me toward the side of the Bible being classified as a fiction book of morals. I am always open to change my views and I always encourage my friends to help me reach that understanding, but it hasn't happened this far.\n\nBut, religion is something that I think I might think of much more often than my most &quot;spiritual&quot; of friends (it's a bold statement, I know). I'm trying to understand religion from a purely logical standpoint and, at the current time, my understanding is this:\nI think that the question of a higher power is something that plagues all living beings capable of thought. But I view it as philosophy. The archeological record has shown us civilizations that date back tens of thousands of years which practice religion, not unlike what we see today. This is a notion that runs to the core of who we are as human beings. But, as a firm believer in evolution, I feel that it's a bit egotistical to assume that humans are of a higher class than every other living species on Earth.\n\nNow, here's where I think religion IS real. Let me use the Christian faith as my example for this. If I'm &quot;saved&quot; by God and I swear to live my life according to the values of the Bible, I will go to heaven. This is something that was really hard for me to science my way into understanding for a while, but I have an idea. When a person is asleep, a chemical called dimethyltryptamine(DMT) is released in your brain and this causes vivid hallucinations. The interesting thing about DMT is that your brain becomes flooded with it (more so than when you're dreaming) when you're born and when you die. Now, to recap, if I am a Christian and I believe that I lived my life according to the morals set forth by Jesus Christ, when I die and my brain becomes flooded with DMT, I will know that I lived a &quot;morally correct&quot; life. Thus , I believe my final moments of consciousness will be in my own DMT-induced heaven. However, if I die and my conscience feels that I was a &quot;morally wrong&quot; person, my DMT-induced trip will be of a hell-of-sorts.\n\nTherefore, I believe that heaven and hell are both very real &quot;trips&quot; that you experience upon death, and your conscience plays the role of God, deciding where you &quot;go.&quot; And I believe that one's spirituality and their ability to uphold good morals (subjective) throughout their life is the determining factor as to which trip you experience. I cannot discount the existence of a higher power (because you can't prove that something doesn't exist), but I'm skeptical. Always skeptical. And, to me, this logically makes the most sense.

I frequent INTJforum. There are times when I\'m inspired to get involved in their religion/mythology section (which is hidden from view unless you have over 80 posts on that board). It looks like about a quarter of the INTJs there are believers in one faith or another.\n\nI personally treat the whole thing as a purely scientific matter.\n1)We are ultimately talking about the structure of the universe.\n2)The properties of the universe are the only authority; accuracy exists if, and only if, it perfectly aligns with what Mother Nature says.\n3)Humans tend toward fancy when dealing with these matters so it\'s best not to pay attention to them when making determinations about the structure of the universe.\n4)The properties of the universe say nothing about the presence of deity. (The only place I\'ve ever seen it hinted at was in the beliefs of believers.)\n5)You probably saw &amp;quot;I\'m solidly atheist""\n\nInteresting points Rift Zone...\n1) One your first point, I believe religion is more concerned with how the universe came into being rather than its structure which would be better answered by physics.\n2) Follows from the first point. The authority would the universe if it can be shown to have created itself.\n3) If we cant take into account the view of humans who else are we to confer with?\n4) you cannot rely on the universe for evidence of a deity. The painter can tell you everything about the painting but the painting couldnt tell you much about the painter. Therefore if there is a Creator it would be impossible to infer the existence by observing Creation.\n', ""Hello June1,\n\nI concede scripture places more emphasis on developing a model of origin. It doesn't seem to address the structure of the universe at all. Irrespective of how much scripture says about the structure of the universe, by including deity in its model it is making some very specific and pertinent determinations about the properties of our universe. Because of this, I can't really isolate its purpose so easily. That is to say I don't believe religion is more concerned with how the universe came into being. I think it was designed to address the nature (structure, properties) and origin of the universe... -and it fails in both.\n\nThe properties of the universe don't support an origin. The univese is eternal."", ""I believe the Bible is the inerrant word of God. Being an INTJ, I am naturally skeptical and have searched out matters from all angles and can only come to the conclusion that, &amp;amp;amp;quot;Yes Virginia, there is a Creator.&amp;amp;amp;quot; I have struggled with many age-old questions that every human being struggles with/through, but my thirst for getting to a viable answer actually led me to greater faith--something at the opposite side of the logic/faith continuum. Talk about an enigma that shocked even me!\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, take The Mathematics of Beauty: (plagiarized from http://www.khouse.org/articles/2004/500/)\n\nIn 1180, an Italian mathematician named Leonardo Fibonacci discovered a strange sequence of numbers that have since attracted the attention of many perceptive observers:\n\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233 etc.\n\nEach number is the sum of the previous two. It turns out that the ratio of any adjacent numbers approximates (1 + 5())/2 = 1.618. It would be several hundred years before these sequences would be broadly recognized in nature. In floral arrangements, the lily has 3 petals; the yellow violet, 5; delphinium, 8; mayweed, 13; aster, 21; pyrethrum, 34; helenium, 55; and the Michaelmas daisy, 89 - all Fibonacci numbers.\n\nIn the study of phyllotaxis, the spiral arrangement of leaves around a plant's stem, the leaves of the elm are arranged at 1/2 circumference; the beech and hazel, 1/3; the apricot and oak, 2/5; the pear and poplar, 3/8; the almond and pussy willow, 5/13; pines, 5/21 or 13/34; etc. In a review of 434 Angiospermae and 44 Gymnospermae, they all involve Fibonacci numbers! It turns out that this maximizes their exposure to sunlight and air without shading or crowding from other leaves.\n\nIn the study of seeds, the rows of bracts on pinecones are 8 and 13; pineapples, 8, 13, and 21; etc. The optimum divergence angle of 137.5 degrees produces the best packing. That's why you see Fibonacci spirals in the seed heads (sunflowers, etc.) But what's really astonishing is that this peculiar sequence is far more pervasive than in just botany alone.\n\nIn art, it has long been recognized that there is a relationship known as &quot;the Golden Rectangle&quot;. This has the peculiar property in that if you remove a square, you still retain the same &quot;ideal&quot; rectangle in the remainder. You find this relationship exploited in the Parthenon in Greece, the Great Pyramid in Egypt, the United Nations Building, credit cards, playing cards, postcards, light switch plates, writing pads, 3x5, 5x8 index cards, etc. In classic art, Leonardo da Vinci, Van Gogh, Vermeer, John Singer Sargent, Monet, Whistler, Renoir, Mary Cassatt, Giotto, Durer and others relied on this &quot;golden rectangle&quot; in their designs.\n\nIn music, the various scales are all Fibonacci numbers: most beautiful chords found in music are the major and minor sixths.\n\nMusicians like Bach, Beethoven, Bartok, et al., would divide musical time into periods based on the same &quot;golden&quot; proportions to determine the beginnings and endings of themes, moods, texture, etc.\n\nThis same &quot;Golden Rectangle&quot; is the basis for the &quot;Golden Spiral,&quot; which is the only spiral that does not alter its shape as it grows. This is often noticed in the chambered nautilus, but this &quot;Golden Spiral&quot; also appears in hurricanes, spiral seeds, ram's horns, sea-horse tails, growing fern leaves, the DNA molecule, waves breaking on the beach, tornados, galaxies, the tail of a comet around the sun, whirlpools, seed patterns of sunflowers, daisies, and dandelions; the ears of all mammals; and, the cochlea of the human ear.\n\nWhat is also surprising is that even the orbits of the planets reveal a relationship suggesting the Fibonacci numbers. Penetrate into nature wherever he [the scientist] may, thought has been there before him. Clearly, the same architect that designed the plants, designed the animals, and the universe itself! His fingerprints seem to define beauty itself. God is, indeed, a mathematician.\n\nThere are of course many more scientific arguments that have convinced me of a Creator God, but time and space limit me from posting here and I have no desire to begin a debate. I'm simply stating one aspect of why I believe what I do.\n\nFrom a scriptural standpoint, I have but one word. Israel. Too many prophecies of it's history and recent assent to statehood in 1948 have been fulfilled, in addition to prophecies about Jesus first (and second) coming.\n\nNonetheless, as an INTJ, not being the touchy-feely type which--in my pre-knowledgeable INTJ days--rocked my little faith world! I thought there was something wrong with me because I thought feeling was tied to faith. I have a fairly well-developed Fe, but still, I can't get emotionally driven by God things as others do (I simply think God things are cool and mindblowing). This was a great article I ran across a few months ago that helped me put things in their proper perspective and reconciled the dissonance that I was experiencing: http://washedintears.com/2014/08/10/being-an-intj-christian/\n\n\n"", '""This was a great article I ran across a few months ago that helped me put things in their proper perspective and reconciled the dissonance that I was experiencing: http://washedintears.com/2014/08/10/being-an-intj-christian/""\n\nRarebird, I saw this in my referrers and signed up simply to respond to your post - I may (will probably) not ever visit this site again.

Unlike todays journalists with their cameras, the bible, for instance, is recorded in part as being ''inspired writing'' The reality is that should you wish to believe in any god, do so very carefully.

Personally, I've kinda settled in an agnostic/humanist area because I can't quite rule the entire idea out but at the same time too I don't think any of the religions have really gotten it right.

This is what bothers me. I personally consider myself a soft atheist. There likely is no God in my honest opinion, but I'm open to discussing it and accepting the idea if there is sufficient evidence. I'm not one of the hard atheists (as I've heard it) who states there is no God. I simply lack any belief in any deity.

I have spent a lot of time researching home based businesses and found one type to be better than all the rest because if done right will develop into a lifetime monthly income. So the purpose of this type of home based business is to develop a monthly income that not only pays all your bills it will allow you to live the life you want to. It is not a get rich thing, it is a lifetime income thing. If done right you will be able to retire from your regular job and never work a regular job again for the rest of your life.

What I do is teach people how to start and run their own business in their spare time. I work as an independent contractor as a brand representative for several company's. What a brand representative does is introduces people to the company's products and services. One of the main parts of every company is what we call the compensation plan. The compensation plan describes how we get paid for being a brand representative. The way it works is when we find someone who wants to become a happy loyal customer we earn a share of the purchase price each month. So basically they pay us a monthly commission. What makes this great is we don't have to find a lot of customers if we do it right. Instead of looking for customers for the company we look for business partners to work with us as brand representatives. Once we find someone to become a business partner we work together as a team of business partners. So it is a business networking group working together to develop a lifetime monthly income together. Working as a business networking group makes it so each person only has to find 3 to 6 more people to become part of the business networking group. So your whole career would just be finding 3 to 6 people who want to own there on business and bring them into the business networking group.

278,329,just a young grasshopper seeking the wisdom of the masters,"[""greetings brainiacs !\nI've recently been getting more immersed in the complexities of myers briggs typology. I am reading a book breaking down the psyche of the enfp and im learning all kinds of good stuff about the different functions. The more I learn about myself though the greater my interest in other types grows though. I thought if anyone would have explored the matter of the different type functions thoroughly it would be a knowledge thirsty intj so Im coming right to the source for more info - what does anyone know about intj functions and also if you know infjs? you both fascinate me so much! many thanks!"", ""Hello Maria, these two videos are really good, they explain a lot about INTJ's.\nWatch this one first- http://youtu.be/8QU8vXUjTLc\nThis one is very funny- http://youtu.be/oME9YjOZqBY\nThe creator of the above videos also describes other types.\n\nHope this helps :)"", ""That is awesome that you are so interested in other personality types. I just got interested in typology a few months ago because I want to learn more about myself and the way I think. I have become fascinated by all the information out there on the subject of typology and personality development. Understanding how are brains are wired seems like something everyone should know but it seems not to many people really take the time to learn about. I been studying the content I found at www.personalityhacker.com for the last few weeks and I am planning on using it to improve my life and in my business. They are experts in typology and have some great content that should help you in your research. Getting people to take me seriously is the biggest problem I struggle with in my life and I'm sure this is a problem for all INTJ's. We are very misunderstood because we see the potential in things where other people don't. For instance I think it is better to work for a company to develop a lifetime income instead of a weekly paycheck. Most people can't grasp that concept so they work for a weekly paycheck till the day they die. I don't see myself as being smarter than other people but as an INTJ can see potential in concepts and career opportunity's that aren't easily grasp by people who are not INTJ. Hope this helps and thanks for your interest in my point of veiw."", '', '', '', '', ""The functions theory as a whole is are to be taken with a grant of salt, as evidence around it is lacking, but it is fun to think about.\n\nNe-extroverted intuition- Is actually one of the most difficult functions to accurately describe. A lot of websites will describe it as projecting your imagination and ideas onto others, but from what I've observed is that it's almost as if a person using Ne is describing the exact process their brain went through to memorize and store information it acquired. Like, when a person is using Ne they're sharing with you every little detail and factoid that they have associated with a particular memory. The mind doesn't memorize things in specific, individual strand, it chunks and groups information together, whether the two bit of information are relevent to one another or not.\n\nNe users really seem to be the most interested in acquiring and sharing information.a lot of people with Ne like to share facts, and memorize and repeat specific phrases or patterns."", ""To be honest i am still figuring myself out and I'm in my 40s. The INTJ brain is not a simplistic one, that's for sure!\nI agree with what Mark said about looking for potential or seeing potential in things that others do not. For me and probably others of the same type this is something that comes so naturally that I hardly am aware of it when I do it.\nI think another reason we can be misunderstood is because all of these thought processes occur within our own minds in such a way that others cannot see them or are unaware of them. Then, when we finally verbalize our thoughts they seem mysterious to others because they cannot grasp how we got from point A to point B. It's not magic it's just hidden away in our minds.\nI think many INTJS feel the need to express their ideas to others, but the exact mode of successful communication can be a little difficult to figure out. Verbal is preferable than written for me, but I have also been successful in the past communicating via artwork.\n\nCan't help with the INFJ conundrum though, sorry. My mom is one and we do have trouble understanding each other on occasion! She is also a total empath and that must come from the F since it's not part of my makeup at all...\n\n""]","['Rationals', 'Personality', 'INTJ - Mastermind']",INTJ - Mastermind

I actually explained INFJ and that helped her to understand me somewhat. My hearts desire was platonic (INFJ like a mug) and for her to get that thing off her chest. Finally she did. She became emotional a few times. That happens a lot when I'm around others as well. I seem to have the ability to poke the core of the heart and the deepest issue that the person was unaware of.

Al Assad is kind of losing so it\'s good, they even made some of the most extreme terrorist groups on Syria look legitimate just so it stay like that, they were funding ISIS too until it became impossible to make them look legitimate.\n\nWhat Al Assad trying to do is to change the Syrian demography, to kill or move all Sunnis outside of Syria so he can rule with democracy and with the help of Shia he can achieve whatever he want. The history of Shia started a few decades after the prophet Muhammed died, Shia means ""followers"", followers of the grand-sons of Muhammed, Hassan, Houssein and their father Ali to be a Khalifa (which is the ruler). You became a Khalifa is most of the people agreed on you to be, but it got taken from them by force and turned into a Kingdom... and while this state is we were talking about today is Saudi, Shia are against Kingdoms and specially on Saudi.\n\nThis explain why Saudi is spreading hate against Shia, and Iran doing that same against Saudi...\n\nSo now in Syria Russia trying to kill civilians and rebels that are out of the part of country where Shia live and secure Al Assad to rule the country again, what scares me is that there\'s no going back now after Russia invested on a war there.

In this day and age where science is progressing faster then ever, it is possible for every country to be completely self sufficient through advances in agriculture, energy production, and social reform. Yet as most of the world is run by a free market, money talks far louder than logic. As imperalism is still the system we function under, the youth of these political states being sapped of resources are likely to become more and more infuriated at their economic situation. As a result they decide to change their future in a way that makes the most sense to them. It is my stance that religion causes a vast majority of the issues this world faces as it allows people to prevent their mind from realising what we actually are which is animals. With the power of our minds working together would be far more productive then killing eachother (overpopulation is a topic for another day). So these young men who are being manipulated by first world powers turn to religion which promises them eternal happiness in exchange for their lives instead of turning toward logic which would help them overthrow their puppet regimes. After that they idealy would be able to rebuild their countries on tenants of logic and productivity. (I'm not saying the capitalist governments are any better but until socialism spreads religion isn't going to be the solution to anyones problems and the faster everyone realises that the sooner we can fix actual issues."", ""It is a mess, that's for sure. An understanding of the root cause is required to prevent scenarios like this from occurring in the future - unfortunately though, the causes for the destabilization of the region and the subsequent festering of ISIS is a pattern that has been repeated all too many times in history.\n\nHousing refugees is an immediate need that must be addressed. Ensuring they have a place to return to is the only long term solution. The long term solution is one devoid of greed and subjective interests, where people are seen as people and not pawns to further power.\nHumans in a mob and powers that be have one thing in common though: Both of them dont have much time for humanity."", 'i havent read the entire thread....\n\nbut yeah i blame america for everything...\n\nthey invaded Afghanistan and created the Taliban.\nthey invaded vietnam (for some reason)\nthey invaded iraq, got nothing turned everything into dust, and then created ISIS\nthey invaded Libya, killed thousands.\n\nTHEY NUKED Japan twice, but then gave 5~50 billion dollar in ECONOMIC aid (in 1950s) (not military aid) today japan is the worlds biggest economic powerhouse, with highest trade with the US.\n\nThey cannot invade north korea because China would not let them to, see the peace in that country,even though people are hungry, atleast they are not dead and their families hungry. thank you china.\n\nthey are bombing Isis and saying they are terror.\nquick fact: Saudi Arabia, excutes more people each year than isis has executed since its inception.\n\nthe funny thing is Saudi arabia is a key ally, and isis is a world threat.\nwhen the truth is Isis and therebel fractions are directly (i repeat) directed getting funded by the oil money of the saudis.\n\nthe list goes on and on.\n\nwhat bothers me the most is america is the bad evil side in every war.\nand its citizens speak as if they are the saviours of this world. quite frankly you people have no right to speak up for the world.\n\nyou are just murderers disguised in the clothes of democracy and freedom.\n', ""Given that individual life inevitably ends in defeat and surrenders to death, violent cultures are not necessarily life-denying cultures. What violence does is accelerate the tempo of life, as they inflame the passions, and sharpen the impulses, and give a ruthless economy to actions. Our error is to assume that the buzzwords of peace, stability and happiness are self-defending concepts, whereas they are merely descriptive of relative concepts set against projected absolute norms.\n\nCategorising every violent movement as generic terrorism has a certain usefulness as propaganda, but it does not really reveal the distinctness of the characters and ideologies involved. Sure, you can group together figures such as Anders Breivik, Osama Bin Laden and Elliot Rodger, and say that they are all losers who had rejected the collective, but you cannot explain why they all chose to do so from a psychologically realistic perspective. We can choose to understand such people, or we can choose to defeat their causes via political propaganda. Doing both simultaneously is nigh-impossible.\n\nI tend to think that touting the power of education to socially engineer your desired outcomes is a bit naive. Education can only be used to socially engineer a desired outcome when those who possess power desire the same outcome as you. Secondly, Revolutionary Islam is a particular manifestation of modernity in a local context. The fact that we in the West do not see it as such speaks to a certain symphony of assumptions which we associate with the word modernity. Yet perhaps the most startling social reality of modernity is the individual's alienation caused by the extreme mobility and fluidity of his environment. This is so in the West and all the more so in the Arab world. Traditional tribal associations vanish as men seek brotherhood in a body of abstract concepts. In the West we call it ideology, but in the local context, some people call it Islam.\n\nIf you think that Western ideology does not have the capacity to glorify violence, think again. A few months ago, in response to the murder of Charlie Hebdo staff, the French people sang the national anthem in a chorus of demonstrative defiance, among the words of which are: Let their impure blood/Soak our fields. Where do they think such words originally came from?"",

289,342,So what's the thing about INFJ?,"['Hey!\n\nI\'m a relative newcomer to the MBTI and Enneagram community, and it seems that the INFJ is the only type of woman that will truly (under)stand me. Naturally this intrigues me.\n\nSo my question is: how are INFJ women? Are they ""gamed"" the same way as most other women? Do they ""feel"" more than ""think""? Are they looking for that emotional connection like all other women? Do they give shit tests? ;)\n\nGrateful for any comments, sharing of ideas, and helping me understand more about that perfect being the INFJ obviously must be.\n\nCheers,\nPatrick\nStockholm, Sweden', 'What do you mean by ""gamed""? Your other query about feeling more than thinking, I dont express it quite the same way. I look at it as Intuition guides my thinking, and I tend to express my feelings externally and easily.', ""I think most INFJ's would dislike being termed perfect. We are some of the most self-aware of all the types so we intimately know our strengths and weaknesses. Because of the intuition Lisa mentioned, we seem to easily tap into what others are feeling and their needs. Which is why we are deemed the counselors. But are as far as thinking versus feeling, I'm a very deep thinker (Ghandi was believed to be an INFJ, as well as many famous philosophers). But I tend to make decisions based more on my gut feelings than an over-analyzed decision."", ""I've spent a little time reading about this type and I am honestly intrigued, so I guess my question really is: if infj don't seem to fall for the typical come-ons and banter, what are the secrets to making her fall for me?"", ""I know few INFJ's..one is my sister. She is a weirdo/an outcast, but very creative. She feels like no one understands her, always thinking deeply,, dislikes superficiality.\n\nTo really capture an INFJ is to be genuine. Let her know you're not judgmental of her. She wants to be accepted for who she is, even if she is quiet and deep thinking; not much people accept this. She is looking for someone who will accept her. Also, be friendly even if she seems unfriendly, she is just guarding herself. She wants people to be friendly with her, that shows acceptance. She will open up if show you are genuine.\n\nAlso, show her your creativity/your original ideas, show that you are not superficial, you care for people not by how they look, she believes souls more important than the appearance. (So, instead of calling her pretty/beautiful, say you are interested in her qualities).\nAlso, be funny/witty so she can see the good side of life. Should be no trouble since you are ENTP.\n\nThis is just what I know of my sister. She is truly INFJ."", '""I\'ve spent a little time reading about this type and I am honestly intrigued, so I guess my question really is: if infj don\'t seem to fall for the typical come-ons and banter, what are the secrets to making her fall for me?""\n\nWell PatrickHappy,, I guess a good start is to ask how she really is... as in don\'t say ""Hi how are you"" and expect that pleasantry to be satisfactory for INFJ. Instead ask her how she really is and when she answers, don\'t respond with suggestions of things she could do differently/better (i.e. problem solve her response).\nAsk her thoughts on something thats important to her.\nDig deep in yourself and give her meaningful responses to her questions of you. Show your depth of thought.\nWell those are the sorts of things that \'show me\' who a person really is, as thats what I really want to see.

Personal experience, so subjective observation and not a fact."", ""I agree with livelovelaugh, I'd say the most important thing is to be genuine. As INFJ (in my opinion) we are more closed off than others, and tend to feel misunderstood, or 'special', so we usually don't have much friends, but tend to have real connections with the few people that we interact with, that's what we're looking for, someone true and open with whom we feel a real connection, a deep understanding.\nI don't know ENTPs very well, so that may not be really adapted to your type in particular.\n\nThat being said, it's not so much about the type than about the person herself. I mean, don't go and push things with someone just because of her type. every INFJ is different, like any other types, MBTI is just a general indication about personalities.\nAlso, there's no 'dating secret' that would immediately win someone over, of any type.

Do not judge me. We're sensitive and there's nothing you can do to change that. Do not make us feel like we're overreacting. We want someone that will understand us and yes we want that emotional connection but personally I sure as hell won't make it easy for you. It's not a 'game' though I'm basically protecting myself, I've been used way too many times to be trustful. We have a thick shell but under it we're very upfront. If I'm not talking very much it's not necessarily that I don't like you I'm just shy, or analyzing you. Show interest, but be careful to not get into our bubble. If an INFJ starts avoiding you, give up they don't like you but are too nice to say it. As a romantic interest, I want someone I can talk with about my interests whether it's videogames, books, philosophical and rhetorical questions or politics, someone interesting (and funny). We're very Thinking, what makes us Feeling is that we use that Ti to help people because we truly care. Listen to my problems but don't try to solve them for me, talking about the problem doesn't mean I don't know the answer to it, I just need to talk it out.

I haven't had much practice with meditation for it, but I have gone to a therapist in two different series of visits."", 'Going to a therapist if definitely a good way, especially if the anxiety is strong.\n\nBut I also agree with Astrym on following a healthy diet.

I don't actually know a lot of INFJ's in person, so I can't tell you if it really is an INFJ thing, but most most of my introverted friends have anxiety, so it seems like a big theme for most introverts based off of my experiences.

I feel fulfilled, enlivened, kinda complete when I use my 'gifts' to serve others. I share their reward of being understood and sharing their burden that they have or question they've been pondering for God knows how long. I still struggle to compose my emotions when the energy or essence of a person, family, thought or situation diffuses into me which in turn needless to say is awkward. Simultaneously, I don't care because of the appreciation in my heart to been given the opportunity to co-mingle with such an experience."", ""I often feel like an outsider experiencing an alternate reality. On rare occasions I meet someone similar and it feels like coming home. I spend time alone to collect my thoughts and reflect. I can be extroverted when the need arises, but it takes a lot of energy. I prefer small intimate gatherings when social, wear out quickly and feel the need to escape at larger events and parties. I gain insights when spending time with people and once in a great while I sense something about a person and we just look at each other for a bit. I'd like to talk about these things with that person, but it's awkward and I know that it will make them feel uncomfortable, so I'll wait for another time and try to reach them then. The women I've fallen for have all been the result of an intuitive sense about them first, then much later finding out that they all have shared similar traits and life experiences. I'm very selective of who I trust to share myself with, but as I get older I'm beginning to be more open, probably because I'm more secure in myself and their reactions aren't as threatening as they once were."", 'Being and INFJ male is an adventure, usually a lonely one, at least in my case. I understand people iinstinctually but am often let down by them. I have Passionate relationships with women that end in a lot of disappointment and often ugliness due to loosing control of the emotional side and lashing out because I feel so wounded at a very base (i would say soul) level. It\'s hard to get myself to open up and take a chance on someone yet I find myself very lonely at times due to my hesitation to do so. Being highly intelligent on top of things leads me to analyze, often too much, what peoples motives may be and where I fit into the puzzle of life. I am content in my distractions but not truely happy. Being single makes me feel like I am missing out on my purpose in life yet at times I am happier not dealing with the complexity and potential hurt of a relationship.

A true INFJ male isn\'t comfortable in this world. It\'s like being a \'3D\' person in a land of \'2D\' people - cardboard cut-out without real substance. Dating is a problem, because no \'normal\' woman is capable of seeing the real \'you\', and forming a close emotional bond difficult or impossible. Most disregard you as \'odd\', and attraction is never mutual. You are a great \'friend\' but never, never seen as a potential lover. Since you have to have attraction and a close emotional bond for sex that becomes a barrier that\'s almost impossible to overcome. Despite that I\'ve been married twice and in both cases it turned out they were more interested in what I could give them and not in me as a person at all. Though they voiced all that at the start of the relationships, the truth came out later. Stop being able to be the \'gravy train\' and suddenly you find yourself alone. Or worse (one wife tried to kill me for the insurance). So it\'s no laugh, and I think those that pretend to be an INFJ male are idiots. True INFJ males are lonely not as much by choice but because they want a depth few women can or are able to provide.', ""As if to illustrate the paradoxical nature of an INFJ, I simultaneously embrace and curse my type. Never am I more infatuated with my functions than when I'm alone and able to revel in them completely and without interruption, embarrassment, or judgement (I judge myself enough for the entire population of earth, thank you). Inject me into the outside world where I'm habitually unable to share my wholeness to the positive reception of anyone and I immediately become disdainful of my makeup. I can play the game and be fun, likable, humorous, consoling, and counseling but the entirety of my external existence is hollow and meaningless and without true, authentic passion. To maintain the facade is to be generally accepted and secure relationships - shallow though they may be - but to be true to myself is to risk widespread rejection and criticism and invite ostracizing. I've conditioned myself to believe that loneliness by choice is far better than the same by force."", '.', ""In one word - (Lonely) I often feel like an old soul that is trapped in another dimension where I continuously feel... Disassociated and disconnected with the vast majority of the people that I choose to interact with. My introversion and seclusion was much worse when I was younger. After having time to mature, reflect, and appreciate what I do have I have come to understand that my place in this world will be cemented in one of two ways: either I will become a part of a greater humanitarian effort to help as many people as I can or the darkness that exists within me will lead me to a path of death and destruction. It's difficult to describe the constant-roaring tsunami of energy and emotions that makes up the duality that exists within me but I'm sure most of us simply just want to feel understood and loved by those we choose to show ourselves to. Modern advancements and heavy reliance in technology as well as a fickle developing society that embraces temporary flings and disregards things such as appreciation of natural environments and the value of relationships that hold meaning and family often leaves us feeling very isolated and lonely as I said before. In the end, we are left with the decision to choose between becoming a part of a society that we do not believe or truly associate with or to remain in solitude and have hope that someday we will find what we are looking for.

I really wanted to make our relationship work and I felt like we were right for each other in so many ways but it just wasn't enough for me. I found myself looking outside of the relationship for someone new online but I told the girl pretty much immediately (within the first day) that I already had a girlfriend and that I didn't intend to cheat, also no I never really intended to but I know myself, I was very unhappy. The fact that I was looking at all signaled to me I just needed to come clean and let her go no matter how much it killed me. I don't technically consider it cheating since all we ever did was talk but that isn't how she saw it. Cheating really isn't in my nature but then nether are casual flings, just finding someone to date is a total pita.\n\nSo to answer your question I think perhaps if an infj is in a committed relationship with someone they truly love, but incredibly unhappy they may end up cheating as a desperate attempt to get out."", ""Well, I had a conversation like this yesterday, with other INFJ's. Most would be monogamous though, because we don't want to hurt anyone.

So you are just like... searching for this connection, but you can't find it with only one?\n\nbut explain monogamous. So IMO you're together and in a relationship with someone, the moment the both of you decide you are, and you have kissed the other. But like Schanady explained, if you're only talking with someone, you're not cheating. You cheat when you do it on purpose, and kiss someone else than your partner on the mouth.\n\nbut as someone cheats, I doubt the relationship will be left standing. Because in the end, I think an INFJ wants to be monogamous.\n\nUnless.. you are raised into the believe that you are polygamous. If your examples/teachers/parents are polygamous, I guess an INFJ will become polygamous as well, to not feel like they are alone or hurting people by turning your back on traditions?"", 'As INFJ i can think to have multiple wives, but everything would have to be under the sun.

It takes one to know one, and there is no chance for a soulmate experience with anyone else.\nHowever if one of them is unstable and has weakspots in the function stack it can be a disaster. Can you imagine an INTJ being fine with themselves, being stuck in an unhealthy Se loop? Unlikely. And the other INTJ will not appreciate it either.

I used to be really insecure. Because deep down I didn't like myself and didn't expect other people to like me, I built up a pretty bad superiority complex and my taste in women reflected on my desperate need for validation more so than on my strong but latent desire for visceral communion. So, when I was emotionally unhealthy, I showed my interest through pretty overt, dramatic romanticism. Now that I've grown up and dealt with the great bulk of my baggage, I'm more discrete and I take longer to get to know someone before I admit any emotion toward them. I would say that if your INTP is intentionally spending time with you, specifically, seeking you out, specifically, for conversation, and holding eye contact with you even just a tad longer than they should - barely enough to notice - they probably like you and will probably either tell you as much soon or would hypothetically respond positively to your inquiry on the matter."", ""as a former INTP (don't ask me what that means :-D ) I'd say an INTP that likes you has probably already made moves. You just didn't realise they were 'moves'. Showing in-depth interest in things you like to an almost analytical level. Asking your opinion on things that they could easily figure out themselves. Being openly vulnerable, e.g. admitting when they're wrong or letting you know when they feel uncomfortable about something. Sharing their latest thoughts/ideas/discoveries with you the minute they think of it (which shows you're on their mind... this one is a biggie)"", ""Sometimes you do have to make the first move because at times you need to use the ?œbat to the head??method of saying your interested. There were times when I only figured out (far to late) someone was flirting with me. Depending on how introverted one is, leaving behind messages like notes or letters (from him or to him) might also help.\n\nFinally he might seem to go slower than others unless one is anxious to just get all this dating crap done and over with. I noticed both extremes with INTPs. Most are those who like to take their time in getting to know someone far to long than normal, and may 'pre-date'. Others, who don't like this idea of dating at all (seeing it confusing, illogical, more trouble than its worth, etc), will quickly jump over that hurdle if someone shows an interest unless one is clearly not right for him."", ""You will probably have to make the first move.\n\nLike mentioned above I have had women so obviously coming onto me and it completely went over my head. I only recognised it when I was running things over in my head later. I think for INTPs it's best if you make it explicit rather than suggestive.\n\nThe way I used to show interest in girls I was attracted to was by deliberately seeking to talk to and spend time with them. Chatting to them on FB or whatsapp or whatever a lot.\n\nI think if they're deliberately spending time communicating with you, there's a good chance they're into you."",

After a little research was I sure that I was not an ISTP, so for quite some time I thought I was an INTJ. But, the more research I did, the more I realized I was definitely an INTP. To the uninitiated the two types are very similar but these are the key points that, I think, most clearly differentiate them:\n\n1) INTP learn for the sake of learning, we want to know everything about what we are currently fascinated about. INTJ learn what they need for a specific project, their learning is with purpose, not random.\n\n2) INTP are content with the learning, we have no need to practically apply any knowledge we acquire. INTJ seek knowledge specifically for it's practical application, which is why their learning is so purposeful. INTP seek knowledge to understand, INTJ seek knowledge to accomplish a goal."", ""3) INTP are more rigorous in collecting 'pure data'. We need the best data possible because our goal is complete understanding of the universe, so every piece needs to fit into the massive jigsaw puzzle we each have inside our heads. An INTJ is less concerned with data purity and more concerned with how well it serves it's purpose, which is whatever system they are currently working on.\n\n4) INTP do not care where data comes from. If a concept is correct, it is correct regardless of source, never because of. An INTJ places a higher value on data from respected sources, even if the data is of lower quality.\n\n5) INTP are more conditional in speech, we tend to couch everything in potentiality. INTJ are more confident and assertive when speaking, they make much more strongly declarative statements.\n\n6) INTP find social expectations offensive, to be expected to conform in speech or dress angers us at a core level. If forced to comply it will feel inauthentic and just...dirty. An INTJ finds social expectations amusing. A mature INTJ will even play along if it provides them with a desired result.""]","['Rationals', 'INTP - Architect', 'Personality']",INTP - Architect

302,356,INFJ-ENFP vs. INFJ-ENTP,"[""Hi fellow infjs,\n\nI have a question about the most recommended pairings for infj. I have experience with enfp but not with entp.\nTo me it seems the enfp corresponds to the ideal partner I've always had in mind: extroverted but not too egocentric, loving people, naturally generous, and driven by his ideals. It's like me, but out there, where I wish I could be. My last passion was for an enfp, although of course it's not a magic recipe - I had a relation with another one and even though I appreciated his qualities a lot, the spark was just not there. Apparently it works better if we have a common goal.\nSo I'm wondering about entp: supposedly they are not as morally consistent as the enfp, so how the infj deals with that? To me it seems it would be a major drawback. So what is this infj-entp special bond all about? I think I've never met a male entp, so I can't talk from experience. Only met a female entp, I think she was at first irritated by my (too) gentle behaviour but once we had a very long conversation that left me almost dizzy because I had forgotten about everything else. So how is it in romantic relationships?"", ""Hello infj.\n\nI wish I could tell you.\nAlthough MBTI is a great theory, it can't hold true for everyone we meet.\nThere is a definite connection between the two types. But it seems that it depends on much more than compatibility. Attitude and perception are very important.\n\nEveryone has a different attitude.\nEveryone perceives differently.\nDon't shrug aside your feelings! Be safe.\n\nWill."", '(Double post)', ""Yep. Sometimes I wish I didn't know about MBTI so I would stop over-analyzing and just trust my guts."", 'I think that sometimes too.', 'Yeah to me there would be a natural hurdle in feeling v/s thinking.. but I have never interacted with a known ENTP either..', 'I know a lot about infjs and what are great matches, depending on your desires, your fulfillment would really be exemplified in intjs, followed by an ntp,, if you core desire is same values and functioning its enfjs, infjs and infjs never work as i know, all my infj friends say its weird dating themselves, intj is #1 pick', 'I suspect the MBTI gives some knowledge which can be used to make better mistakes :)', ""I have been in two longterm relationships with ENFPs and it ended very, very badly. In fact, I would classify those relationships as the worst, most destructive relationships I have ever been in. Because (as types) we are both so responsive to the other's emotional states, it seems that we cannot pull out of a death spiral once it's begun, whether we meant it to have begun or not.\n\nHowever, I'm loathe to make blanket assessments based on 2 bad relationships.\n\nI've been in relationships with ESTPs and ESFPs, but to my knowledge, never an ENTP so I can't give any firsthand account of it. Would that I could. I am curious to know."", ""Definitely, definitely ENFP, I would go there with out a doubt, for an amazing bonding experience and someone who will likely understand you really well and the chance to develop a rare and special love.\nI find while i can get on well with ENTP's generally, too much time with them is exhausting and sometimes gets on my nerves. But the ENTP's i know(and it's only two people.) do have a propensity to argue for the sake of arguing and be self destructive at times, they also tear my ideals to shreds and I find that very hard.\nBut you have to do what is right for you, just using type alone we ignore the richness and diversity of people, whose type gives similar preferences and tendencies, but can still be very, very different people within type."", ""Looking at past relationships, i prefer ENTP males over ENFP males. Like with what arkay said. In my experience the ENFP guys were actually the ones that were more selfish and egocentric - not to say ENTPs aren't but I find that I can relate with them more. Two NFs together can really hurt each other with their deep sensitivities. It can be very difficult to maintain once someones feelings are too hurt :(\n\nThe ENTP moral inconsistency i think is why they are such a good match for an INFJ... we bring new perspective into each others lives and balance each others stubborn views on things (after many hours of debate and chuckles of course). And they aren't quite as unpredictable in the bad sense.\n\nWhen an ENFP is unhealthy they'll manipulate, when ENTP is unhealthy they'll get dramatic. I would rather deal with illogical NT drama (because I can snap them back into their senses) than manipulation from someone who i thought I could really trust (no one to snap ME back into my senses).\nOnce I read that INFJ and ENTP are like two sides of the same coin, and I definitely support that... in contrast ENFPs have always confused and saddened me in the end.. so far at least. I think maybe ENFP females and INFJ males would work better than INFJ females ENFP males."", ""I've never been in a relationship relationship with an ENTP, but I did talk with one for a while, & from my point of view, it was absolutely wonderful. Both of our Ns working together found us talking & laughing for hours, & he could see through me in ways I never expected of anybody, which is simultaneously disconcerting & thrilling. I know that my profile says I'm an ENFP, but I'm a pretty solid X (which is obviously not an option), & so to have someone draw me out of a moment of hesitancy & introverted panic was an insanely intoxicating feeling. The issue that ended things though was the decision to stick to my innermost morals & beliefs, rather than sacrifice them & inevitably come to the same choice down the road. Now, if I had the chance to be with an ENTP whose morals did align with mine, I would totally try it again, but I know that other ENTPs that I'm friends with struggle with keeping other people's sensitivities in mind, & NFs like to be both understood and supported emotionally, so I don't know how well it would actually turn out in the end.\nOn the flipside, I know some really amazing & solid ENFP males who are stereotypical healthy, eccentric but fun loving ENFPs, & it is my personal -only a little biased - belief that everyone should at least have an ENFP friend, if only for the encouragement that you're awesome & there is adventure in everything. I think that when push comes to shove, it all comes down to maturity & finding one's balance, as well as coming into your own wants & needs."", 'I try to use MBTI as a support to my gut instinct. Problem is only, whey the evaluation turns out to be equal (which is mostly an illusion).', 'Well, this seems like quite the one-sided argument going on here. I prefer the term ""morally ambiguous"", thank you; and that\'s actually a bad label as well. Just because it\'s part of our nature, doesn\'t mean we can\'t control it. Think of it more as the ability to suspend judgement and run with whatever ideas are in your head at the time, but we really do have feelings... sometimes. My favorite hobby is to make people laugh. I\'m not sure who follows Enneagram, but I\'m a 7w6 (Enthusiast) vs the more common 7w8 (Excitement Seeker) model, which some of you seem to be referring to. Enthusiasts demand that life be engrossing and entertaining. To ensure a positive environment, they strive to make life fun for others as well. Excitement Seekers are fully engaged in experiencing the world. Enjoyable and exciting activities, which may include acquiring material goods, help Excitement Seekers escape from a harsh or boring reality. In other words, I\'m closer to an INFP, while 7w8 is closer to an ESTP. I\'m not the best at explaining the difference, so here\'s a forum link with no warranties expressed or implied:\nhttp://personalitycafe.com/type-7-forum-enthusiast/105770-7w6-7w8-differences.html\n(I didn\'t actually read that, so I hope it supports my point.)\n\nOn the MBTI side, as an ENTP, Ti (introverted thinking) is my second function. It\'s my second highest priority, where as an INFJ (if you follow the system) it\'s your third function. Fe (extroverted feeling) is my third cognitive function, just like Fe is your second function. Basically, both of us are able to think to ourselves (internally), but talk about our feelings (externally), instead of using Fi (introverted feeling) which is the second function of the ENFP. Wow, this is getting boring for me, too. Time for a video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up0mk3YTQus\n(Dave is an ENTJ. He\'s a little rough around the edges, but I think he\'s hilarious. Pretend he\'s House MD.)\n\nI would say that most of the time we seem cold or callous, we either have no idea it\'s happening (we are stuck inside our own heads), or we think we are being funny (even though you think we\'re not). I haven\'t met many of us who couldn\'t turn our attitudes around on a dime, like it had all been an act, with just a simple acknowledgement. That I believe is where the INFJ comes in. You have that special gift of actually listening, which is what we crave most. Not that everyone doesn\'t want to be heard, but because of our crazy ideas and random thought patterns, people usually stop listening to us. Most people can\'t actually follow along, but with very strong Ni (internal intuition), your primary function, you actually can. Conversely, ENTPs are really patient, and really good at picking up on environmental cues. Which means when you want time alone, or if you aren\'t ready to talk about something, we probably know. Er.. it\'s hard to explain the feelings and stuff, but here\'s a website with a picture of puppy to help me explain:\nhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/ilincavalentina/eight-reasons-infjs-and-entps-are-a-match-made-in-nf6k\n\nI hope that helps a bit.

""The main point is to find a mature ENxP. You can have a lot in common with both types, but it burns down to how comfortable you are to open up and actually get to know the person.\nI think that ENTPs and INFJs can click very well. Yeah, we can seem a bit overbearing, it is our default mode to talk a lot (and I mean A LOT) whenever we are meeting someone new, but we mainly do it just to overcome all the awkwardness involved in introducing one another and then to jump-start the conversation as the introvert is rarely the one to speak up first. We really do it for your benefit. And while we can seem somewhat unstable on the outside, we have morals and are likely to value your emotions as long as you don't try to manipulate us (that simply doesn't work). But you might have to consider that we might be a little inconsiderate towards the general public at times. We can be loyal, we stick by you, but we have no qualms about being cold-hearted bastards to everyone else."", 'You have GOT to meet an ENTP!! It\'s amazing and intoxicating! I\'ve only recently become very interested in MBTI, and it\'s changed my life--everything makes sense now lol\nIn my life I\'ve had some incredibly close friendships--around seven best friends--and five of those best friends were INFJs (don\'t you guys make up like 1% of the population?!). Somehow we just attract each other!\n\nI really don\'t know how to explain a relationship with you guys. You just understand and you care and you listen and for some inexplicable reason you find us hilarious! We can talk intellectually or tease each other endlessly. I had an INFJ friend tell me once, ""I feel like I could never get tired of you. It\'s always exciting even when its not."" And, it\'s totally true! We could talk for hours and hours every day or even just not talk and not get bored of each other.\nHOWEVER, by the same token, since we can fall so deeply in love with you guys and we invest so much emotionally in each other, breakups can be really really painful (even friendship breakups lol). So its a risk you have to decide whether or not you want to take\n\nWhat do you mean by ""morally consistent""? Though ENTPs can be pretty confrontational, we do care/consider others\' emotions (if those emotions make sense logically); when we debate others its not to hurt others, it\'s to understand, to come to a solution, or to exercise our minds. It\'s fun to be the devil\'s advocate. We\'ll many times debate from the other side just because it\'s fun/an adventure not because we actually really believe it or agree with that side. Personally, I have very strong morals and values, and I have a good ENTP girlfriend who also has very firm beliefs about religion. However, we\'ll often debate about it, wanting to understand truth or just for the heck of it, it\'s not personal or determinative of moral fluctuation/abandonment, it\'s just fun. I thought INFJs liked philosophizing.\n\nPersonally, I believe relationships between ENFP and INFJ are good but I think ENFP-INTJ is better. And ENTP-INFJ relationships are better than ENTP-INTJ relationships. I have two sisters, one is an ENFP and one is an INTJ. I feel that the ENFP sister gets along better with my INTJ sister than I do as an ENTP. Also, I\'ve had many more INFJ friends than my ENFP sister and my friendships with INFJs have been very long-term whereas I feel that the friendships I\'ve seen between ENFP and INFJ were more casual/less-committal. Idk. its just my opinion.', ""You are so right...a warm hug from a nice INFJ liking ENTP based in Frankfurt\nA bientÃ´t,\nChristoph (malheureusement sans 'e' a la fin :-)""]","['Romantics ', 'Personality', 'INFJ - Counselor']",INFJ - Counselor
303,357,do you guys find it hard to say no?,"['Despite having a fiercely independent ""you can go fuck yourself"" disposition I find that badass disposition that im proud of gets shadowed by my desire to people please, keep the peace, and my geninuine comfort with going with the flow. However i find that i say ""yes"" so often that i end up getting walked all over and not getting my needs met while also feeling untrue to my ""strong"" assertive principled self. Do you guys have this issue too? How do you stop getting walked all over?', ""Fuck yeah if I know what you mean. I'll leave space for another ENFP to hopefully share some wisdom. Because I got the knowledge about this that you probably also do. But wisdom is applied knowledge. And yes this is excruciating sometimes. Sometimes you just feel like something else actually but end up going with the flow and losing energy one drop at a time and then you feel like you're lying to yourself and hence everyone else and it's annoying."", ""I think almost every ENFP can relate to this.\n\nI've just recently started to use my words to my advantage. It's a very hard thing to do. I often have to make lists and present them to the person I'm communicating to. During confrontation I usually experience the standard feelings that go along with opposing someone else. Adrenaline, shaking limbs, broken voice. It's a hard thing to move through.\n\nIt is possible to confront someone in a non-threatening way. Although it can be incredibly difficult, as there is such a small target in conversation to oppose someone's actions in a friendly way. Especially if you're involved with the situation firsthand.\n\nIn order to prevent myself from getting trampled, I speak in clear facts and actions. Bringing attention to someone else's actions can have great effect, as long as you do it in a strong but neutral way. I also find that non-verbal communication and eye contact are strong factors in opposition, seeing as they communicate many different things on many different levels. Non-verbal communication can also do a lot of your opposing for you.\n\nI can confirm, female eye contact is a very strong tactic.\n\nI'm sure you understand exactly what I'm talking about if you're an ENFP. It's all about using your intuition to navigate the situation while remaining neutral. If you're calm and friendly, you won't give anything for anyone to grab onto. They have nothing to use against you.\n\nUse your aptitudes in these situations. Do not neglect confidence or non-verbal language.\n\nThanks for reading! Thanks for the topic.\nWill."", 'I find I have to tell people to give me some time to think about it. I usually need a little for my emotions to simmer down before committing to something or even saying no. If i accidentally say yes to commit to something and get that anxious feeling knowing i am just caving in, it is hard, but i will go back up to them and say actually I am not going to do this and can usually give a reason. Also find when I am not eating well or getting good sleep the emotion is more overwhelming and it takes longer for me to know what I really feel about the situation', 'Duplicate']","['Romantics ', 'Personality', 'ENFP - Inspirer']",ENFP - Inspirer

Unfortunately it sounds like he knows what he's saying and has definitely thought about the future and may not even see himself married in his successful businessman visions. I would say never lose hope though as love works in mysterious ways and by definition you already have compatible personality types."", ""I think it is unlikely to turn around, especially with TJ type.

If they can figure someone out, they probably don't want to be in a relationship with them. So, maybe an INTJ can confirm or deny this, but I feel like my own success with an INTJ woman, in contrast to the many valiant lads who have been banished to the zone, is due primarily to my comparative novelty and to a lesser extent my utility. INTJ folks are rational to a fault, so you need to add discernible value to their life - they're not interested in entertaining feelings for you until they are convinced it is reasonable and beneficial to do so."", 'In other words: be interesting a.f. If you\'re definitely already friendzoned, I would say leave him alone - for now - and have fun without him. If you\'re sure that you want him, focus on engineering circumstances in your own life that will make him want to invite himself, rather than you inviting him outright. It would probably good to host parties or invite him to go to parties with you that will a.) be mentally stimulating for him and more importantly b.) give you a chance to flex your intellectual muscl....er...sway your intellectual hips within his view without it being ""at"" him.

It sounds like, from the post you made @ave that he doesnt feel like he will have a net value to you (emotional baggage, etc).\n\nMental stimulation is a must for us, yes, but I havent met an ENFP that wasnt curious enough about the world to be interesting.\n\nMy suggestion: embrace the friendzone. Its actually a good place to he with INTJs. If he already enjoys your presence, spend enough time with him that he wants to start opening up of his own accord. Dont pressure him. When he becomes emotionally open is when you have a chance to leave the friendzone.', 'I had a year-long friendzoned relationship with an INTJ, since neither of us had much initiative when it came to expressing personal feelings.

She would read things into what I said or did that weren\'t meant. It caused quite a bit of friction in that relationship. An INFJ that wants to get involved with an ENTJ must be forthright, and that isn\'t necessarily their nature. To the contrary, an ENTJ that wants to be involved with an INFJ needs to tone down criticism, or anything that can be perceived as criticism.\n\nHad dated an INFJ woman who was an engineer once. She was smart as a whip. We could talk romance, we could talk tech, science, engineering. However, her politics tended towards the far left. And I get that INFJs are super-super compassionate and loving people. However, the laws of human nature and economics don\'t necessarily follow with compassion, and that was a serious sticking point with us. She would sometimes make up facts, and stupidly, I\'d fact check her on the internet to find out, lo and behold, that her ""facts"" were made up, or misremembered. For the INFJs out there (or anyone for that matter), if you are going to date any NT type, particularly ENT of any kind, have your facts straight and verified. NT types will abandon any position that is proven illogical, nonsensical, or what have you. But if your position cannot withstand the assault of factual analysis, then NTs will consider it illogical. And this gets to another point - which is that all NTs can be argumentative. Only a mature NF or INFJ should get involved with an ENTJ.\n\nBut INFJs are generally pretty logical, and almost always super intelligent. If you have common interests in something (tech, science, the arts, music, or almost anything), the deep conversations you have will make you magnetically attracted, once you get to know each other a little, and appreciate each other\'s intellects and POVs', 'Very savvy point, girl!!

I rarely force a conversation to keep going if it isn't flowing naturally, but I try to respond in ways that don't kill it. For people I count as friends (or romantic interests), I expect the initiation to be about equally balanced, and if I think that it's not, I tend to move along. If I'm communicating with someone I care about, it would be impossible for me to lose track of communication. If I don't respond, it's almost always a deliberate choice. Of course, each person of my type is different!"", ""Even though I'm not an INTJ, I do have some insight into this matter. :)\n\nAll the INTJs I've ever been friends with (and I have MANY INTJ friends) have sort of initially relied on me to initiate conversation. This period can last as long as two weeks to several months. I typically don't mind-because I can tell that they have genuine interest in hanging out with me. So I'll ask them if they want to do something Saturday night, they'll say yes...and so on and so forth.\n\nHowever, all the INTJs I've been romantically involved with (almost all my exes have been INTJs) have usually been the first ones to initiate a conversation. They'll text me throughout the day and ask ME to do things with them. And this works out perfectly because I get shy when I meet an INTJ that I like. Eventually it'll taper off to a level where we're both contributing equally."", 'ok,yes,yes,yes and no!', ""Hey, I'm an INTJ. Usually I am the one to start conversation, if I actually like someone. Problem is, I usually don't like most people because I feel like most people are out there to use me, whether they mean to or not. My friends are a weird subject. I'll go through phases where I love my friends. And after a short period of time, I'll completely cut off connection with everyone altogether. But this is mostly due to my depression problems. People with my illness often describe it as being a self-destruct or purge at the start of serious depression attacks. When I receive texts, I reply immediately and very carefully and my replies are usually long, thought out, and very carefully checked for grammar and spelling mistakes. As far as friendship vestedness goes, when I'm happy with my friends or with myself, I'll bend over backwards to give my friends things. If I'm upset, I'll often avoid them at all costs. Does all that answer your questions?"", ""I know I don't make friends easily but when I do it's usually for life. I don't like to leave people in limbo when they text me especially if it is important. I do initiate conversation but I refuse to carry it and I'm not fond of drivel. Friendship takes effort from both sides just like any relationship. I give my time and attention to the ones that reciprocate.\n"", 'I have no friends and everyone hates me.', 'you ok? have you been jacked?', 'lol', ""My friends are a distraction from my work. I rarely reach out to them but they all reach out to me. So I drag myself of away from my work to see each one about once a month. Fortunately I can count them on one hand so not too much time wasted.\n\nI guess it's sort of a good thing they drag me out from time to time.\n\nHowever if something is wrong or they have a problem or crisis I will drop everything and go to the aid of my friend."", ""I think it depends on the level of comfort that's going on. I kind of break it down into different classes of people:\n\n1. People I don't know/general public: Generally remain polite/quiet, only efficient communication that's necessary.\n2. Acquaintances/co-workers: Will make some polite conversation, but they aren't going to know much about my actual life and I only talk to them in situations, I don't go actively seeking them out.\n3. Friends of friends: Basically like #2, but only see them in circles with other friends.\n4. Actual friends: Only have a couple and these are some of the people I actually don't mind hanging out with, but a lot of times they drain me so I keep it sporadic to cope but I wouldn't mind a weekly poker game or trivia night or something.\n5. Best friend: There's only one. I consider him family more than some of my own family and could probably hang out almost everyday with him. Been best friends since 6th grade and I'm his best man in his upcoming wedding. I know he's got my back and I've got his.\n\nSo I don't really need a lot of friends...that sounds exhausting, but I do need a couple of good ones. It's tough because right now we are scattered around the country, but online contact helps a lot. As an INTJ, I can keep myself occupied much of the time with my own internal thoughts...but on occasion actual human interaction is good. There are some times I start to feel like too much of a hermit and will actually seek out some company."",

Tell me and prove to me how your work is valuable.

I feel I have a pretty good idea of what INTPs are about. Typically, INTPs feel a conversation is worth having if they are figuring something out. And that actually applies to a lot more as well. INTPs are kind of self centered, like us INFPs, and they feel they have a very good understanding of how the world works, so to speak. So whether it\'s, getting to know someone, figuring out the meaning of a dream, learning how to boost themselves politically, reading a series of books, or obsessing on a project, it all comes down to knowing more. Which they can then apply to their understanding of the ""world"".\n', ""I once dated an INTP who did most of my programming homework for me. I was in a really hard course and every time I'd get an assignment I'd just go home and code for hours and cry. He would come over after class and stay up with me till 5 am figuring it out with me. He was annoyed with me because I couldn't stay on task but he still did most of my homework anyway. :) He wasn't very patient and sometimes he yelled. Lol."", ""Zoet, he was definitely an INTP xD . Aren't they great? and coincidentally, I'm learning to code."", ""Hahaha yeah, I think he sometimes switched between INTJ and INTPs. I read this really interesting article the other day that said that an INTP's biggest fear is being proven wrong, while an INTJ's biggest fear is being emotionally hurt (and it scares them, knowing that they're meant to feel emotion deeply without being given the natural aptitude to express/sense feelings).\n\nWhat language are you learning?

319,377,Mutual vs Conditional admiration,"['I have a hard time understanding when someone says/posts something like ""If a guy really wants me he should be knocking down my door."" And there are similar memes I see on facebook sometimes that say things like ""Chase her. Chase her even when she\'s already yours.""\nIt just makes me think of like a queen and servant type of relationship, rather than a relationship of equals. I couldn\'t imagine being in a relationship like that unless my only need was sex. And if that was the case there is no real need for commitment.\nMy ideal relationship would be with someone who wants me as much as I want her, where we can be actual partners, in harmony. Books I\'ve been reading on accountability and trust have reinforced my stance on that.\n\nI\'m not sure if this has anything to do with MBTI types but it makes me think of the Benefactor relationship type on this type square: http://falconnl.github.io/TypeSquare/', ""Yup, I hate that kind of dating advice which you see everywhere. That if you're a girl you need to play hard to get and act uninterested and make the guy chase you. It only works for people who want to play it like a game. F**k that shit."", ""That's strange-I almost never encounter these kinds of posts..."", ""I'd like to think you're just coming across a loud shitty minority, but you might find it interesting to consider sexual dimorphism in humans as one possible explanation."", ""Yeah, it's not too horribly common, I just see it from time to time, from the same people."", ""Reallly Zoet? People say stuff like that all the time. I agree with Anju. but, I think men need to be braver. What makes a man attractive to me is courage. If you're too scared to talk to me, or if you're not willing to take a risk and show me how you feel, I'll find it very difficult to be attracted to you. It's just not sexy. And I feel like, if a guy is not willing to make an effort at the beginning, how much harder is it going to be for him to make a REAL commitment, when it comes to big things like, moving in together, or getting married if that's your thing, or having kids if that's your thing. Is he gonna be all, ohhh I don't knowww, taking his time and stuff...How you act in the dating phase is a predictor of how you will be in the relationship. If a man shows courage, and maturity, and approaches me, and continues to approach me, not rudely but, with a clear purpose, I'm going to respect that even if I don't find him attractive. Hot guys are a dime a dozen but guys with real guts? That's rare."", ""I understand the need for that. It does take courage to make yourself vulnerable. To your point I could also say women need to show interest if they have interest. I would take playing hard to get literally and assume she's not interested, the last thing I want to do is give someone unwanted attention."", 'Anju, do you carry a blade?\nequality.... shouldn\'t make a difference who asks who. i wouldn\'t make a woman chase me so it would put me off if a woman wanted me to ""chase"" her. it is a form of manipulation, like you say, master/servant. unfortunately this is how a lot of relationships end up. so yeah... F@%K that shit...', 'Clinton, I think you\'re more aware of how your actions affect other people. Giving a woman unwanted attention doesn\'t occur to some men and they will pursue even if they know it\'s unwanted. You are different in that way and you need to find someone equally different in that way. I get it. Many times I think ""well clearly this guy isn\'t interested so I\'m not going to keep talking to him...what\'s the point?"" It\'s a two way street for me too.', ""so do you only talk to guys you're sure are interested in you Brooke?\nAlso isn't this a sort of dating site....

Its more like testing the waters, getting to know the person, then deciding from there. The long term relationships I have been in were men I knew for a period of time first.\n\nI honestly don't consider this a dating site. It's more of networking and meeting new people (remotely) but getting to know new people. I would love to hear others' opinions on this."", ""it IS a dating site, for 1. the name and 2 there are little arrows pointing to who you're suited to.... albeit the worst cos everyone is at least 200 fecking miles apart..... which, again, paradoxically, makes it the best.... and now we've hijacked Clinton's post..."", ""@ruute66\nNo, I don't carry a blade. Why do you ask?"", ""you sound like you don't take any shit..."", 'Hahahahaha XD', 'I think there is another way to look at it.\nThough I agree there are a lot of very stupid posts, that are very confusing, to people who are often already not sure of how to approach and gain the interest of someone they are interested in.\nMaybe it goes back to sweet and quaint old tradition of courting, where a man would spend time actively trying to gain a girls interest and in this way showing her he might be a good husband, because back in the day, once you married, men had all the power, so a girl needed to be sure she married a good man. Maybe there was an element that a woman who was a good catch might have her pick of suitors.\nTimes have changed but elements of this are still there in our culture, in how we flirt and get to know each other, before we commit.\nIt\'s important, I think, to note people court or flirt, in different ways and the best advice I have ever read is to ""be your self."" one man might take me out for dinner and another might take me out for a picnic in the park, for me it\'s flattering that each man is making an effort to gain my interest. Some people will talk for hours, some people are playful, some banter and tease like a game, it\'s up to them how they do it, but very likely the right person for you will appreciate the ways in which you show your affection and make your partner feel wanted - be you male or female.\nWhen a man put\'s in a lot of effort, I find it so hard to resist and feel so flattered. One guy took me out a lot, we did all sorts of stuff and he was always a gentleman (I was a teenager), to the point I wasn\'t sure if we were just friends and I was the only one with a terrible crush. Then one day he made a romantic gesture. But his way of courting me was to get to know me and let me get to know him. Another man for months tried to gain my interest for months with presents and things he said and the answer was always no I have a boyfriend, but it was hard to turn him down over and over, in the face of such ardent pursuit.\nSo maybe chase her should be phrased - let her know she is wanted and do it in what ever way is right for you and her. And maybe ""why isn\'t he knocking down my door"" is really ""I need to know he really wants me and that I am important to him"" and maybe never stop chasing her should be phrased - never stop showing you love and appreciate her. And maybe when we look at things that way, they are not bad things, but how we do them is different for everyone.\nWell that\'s my essay sized opinion anyway lol.', ';> Well....I like certain master/servant relationships ....', ""I think the best advice has been given, be yourself, and realize people are different. I also gave up on applying logic to romance and love. I think it is good to work on self-development, but always on your own terms. I am thinking of working on the resting bitch face to apply at least a Mona Lisa smile when I'm listening to someone...which I do not see as inauthentic, but rather as I do not like to be misunderstood as too critical/negative or anything when internally I am just relaxed or even feeling happy. The rest of the world is more used to using body language.\n\nI think those expressions are indeed in the vein of 'show that you care', even if it is slightly immature. Generally, I find the dating scene somewhat fickle and fast-pace. I would love to go back to the old times, but then again, I am less likely to 'just meet' people, unless they happen to be working with me or meet me through mutual friends. I just feel uncomfortable talking about small talk in a group, it bores me quickly and I feel I have no way to relate to them. How I can then appreciate the pseudo-gossip of my INFP friend of 18 years I do not know:)..."", 'lol @ Monogatari ;)\n\nI agree with Inra on ""do it in what ever way is right for you and her"". The problem is that people often do not know what is right for the other person.\n\nI tend to interpret pursuit in a different way. After I tell someone I\'m not interested, if he continues to pursue me I\'d consider it highly disrespectful. It\'s like them saying ""I don\'t care about your decision. What I want is more important than what you want."" I\'m also somewhat afraid of such people. When you read about women who get acid thrown on them for rejecting men, you see that all of those men display the same kind of obsessive behaviour.\n\nOn the other hand, if I reject someone and he does not try to manipulate me with words/gifts afterwards, that means he respects me and respects my decision. On a couple of occasions I was impressed by how gracefully the guys accepted rejection and left me alone that I ended up changing my mind about dating them. XD', ""@Anju, I totally agree with what you said about guys who don't give up even after you tell them that you're not interested. I HATE it when someone thinks he has a chance even after I've politely said no. At that point, they're just trying to manipulate me with their shady ulterior motives and I can't stand people like that. I usually feel rather than think, and the first feeling that comes to my mind is that this dude is annoying/gross af."", ""@Anju I guess cultural differences play a part. Comparing India to England. Over here guys are very very very unlikely to approach. It can take years to work out if a guy likes you, because we're so repressed and conservative, especially in the South, and the last thing anybody wants to do is offend so we won't even state the obvious. Like, you like me, I like you, why don't we just be together. If I lived in India I might have a different perspective on how men should behave in the dating scene."", 'I cannot personally subscribe to that wistful idea Inra has expressed about courtship. That the chase catches the prey is sure, but the qualities that are required of us to attract a partner are so different from those required to keep one, and it does no good to speak merely of tactics, as if the relationship ends with the moment it begins. It is no accidental occurrence of nature that we often discover who our partners are only after the game had already been played.\n\nIn defense of my constitution I cannot do better than to quote that famous essay of Samuel Johnson:\n\n""By the ancient customs of the Muscovites, the men and women never saw each other till they were joined beyond the power of parting. It may be suspected that by this method many unsuitable matches were produced, and many tempers associated that were not qualified to give pleasure to each other. Yet, perhaps, among a people so little delicate, where the paucity of gratifications, and the uniformity of life, gave no opportunity for imagination to interpose its objections, there was not much danger of capricious dislike; and while they felt neither cold nor hunger they might live quietly together, without any thought of the defects of one another.\n\nAmongst us, whom knowledge has made nice and affluence wanton, there are, indeed, more cautions requisite to secure tranquillity; and yet if we observe the manner in which those converse, who have singled out each other for marriage, we shall, perhaps, not think that the Russians lost much by their restraint. For the whole endeavour of both parties, during the time of courtship, is to hinder themselves from being known, and to disguise their natural temper, and real desires, in hypocritical imitation, studied compliance, and continual affectation. From the time that their love is avowed, neither sees the other but in a mask, and the cheat is managed often on both sides with so much art, and discovered afterwards with so much abruptness, that each has reason to suspect that some transformation has happened on the wedding night, and that, by a strange imposture, one has been courted, and another married.""\n\n', 'Living by that philosophy, my doctrine of courtship is far more futile. It says to the beloved:\n\n""Here I am, no better than as you see me. What you see before you is myself at my worst, and my vow to you is that should you take me, you shall never see me worse than this. Whether I am to be improved by the addition of familiarity and intimacy between us, or by the salvational power of your love and esteem, is beyond my power of promise. Hope for those, if you will, but do not hope that I will ever deceive you by praising myself.""\n\nI don\'t see how I am still single, to be honest.\n\n', ""I'm right here KNich.

323,381,Archaic Crust Theory: (of continents),"['""Fractional Differentiation"" is currently the prevailing theory on the origin of Earth\'s continents. In this view, plate tectonics is older than continents. The story goes: volcanism creates volcanoes, the sea floor migrates and effectively corrals these volcanoes into larger masses, over eons the piles get quite large, eventually you have continents.\n\n""All continental crust ultimately derives from the fractional differentiation of oceanic crust over many eons. This process has been and continues today primarily as a result of the volcanism associated with subduction.""\n-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust\n\nMost scientists believe that there was no continental crust originally on the Earth, but the continental crust ultimately derived from the fractional differentiation of oceanic crust over the eons. This process was primarily a result of volcanism and subduction.\nhttp://www.universetoday.com/73597/what-is-lithosphere/\n\nI have a different perspective to share with you. The Archaic Crust Theory of continents asserts Earth\'s continents are what remains of protoEarth\'s original crust.\n\nThe story starts with protoEarth. It was a world significantly smaller than the one we have now. ProtoEarth had a sister planet that orbited the sun in the same orbit as protoEarth. There\'s a curious phenomena in orbital physics called Lagrangian points that permits multiple bodies to occupy the same orbit. Theia was the name of the other planetoid. Jupiter\'s gravitational influence was most likely Theia\'s demise. Destabilizing its orbit even a little from the Lagrangian point would mean the system would collapse and the two planetoids would eventually collide. If you\'re familiar with with how the Moon formed then you already know some of this story. ProtoEarth and Theia did collide. Fallout from that collision is what our moon formed from.\n\nProtoEarth and Theia had solid crusts. Earlier in their history they were molten balls with no legitimate crust to speak of. Of course, the laws of physics make it pretty clear how the system would develop from there. In liquids, heavy things sink, light things float. And, the second law of thermodynamics sees to it that relatively hot things cool off. It follows our heaviest components (iron, nickel) would concentrate toward the core while the lightest of materials would distribute throughout the surface. It also follows this surface would cool and solidify. Thus is development of planets. ProtoEarth and Theia were solidly within that later stage of development. They had solid crusts of rock that covered their entire spheres. Then they met. About half of protoEarth\'s crust was destroyed upon impact. Of course, this wasn\'t a ""hit and run"" type of event. Theia didn\'t hit us and keep going, it mostly joined us. It is now part of the world we know today.\n\nAs mentioned above, our moon is a collection of some of the fallout from that impact. Some of the mass was lost to space. Most of protoEarth\'s and Theia\'s mass combined to form Earth. Approximately half of protoEarth\'s crust survived the impact but the increase of volume meant the remaining crust wound up covering closer to a third of Earth\'s larger surface area. I find a bit of novelty in this fact: most of humanity doesn\'t live on Earth\'s crust. Technically, the vast majority of us live on protoEarth\'s crust. Unless you live in Hawaii, Tahiti, or other volcanic island, you live on crust that originally formed on a planet that hasn\'t existed for over 4 billion years. A cursory scrutiny of Earth\'s properties and the laws of physics confirms it.\n\nThe implications of Fractional Differentiation demonstrate how it fails to provide an accurate assessment of physical reality. The composition and density of sea floor is known to be very different from continental crust. Frractional differentiation claims all this stuff (our continental land masses) got swept up off the ocean crust. However, the composition and density of continental crust clearly shows it did not originate from oceanic crust. If prevailing theory were correct, continent chemical composition and density would be more similar to ocean floor composition and density. Rather, they are very distinct. It begs the question: where did all THIS stuff come from? This stuff, the material in our continents, clearly came from somewhere else. The ""differentiation"" that is imagined in the current theory is not only wrong, it\'s contrary to physics principals. Plus, the whole ""it all just got swept over to one side"" mentality is shaky to begin with. We don\'t see sea floor getting swept up and adding to continental crust anywhere on this planet. If anything it\'s the reverse of their views: continental crust is adding to oceanic crust.\n\n""Fractional Differentiation"" is a violation of the laws of physics. There will always be geologic activity to keep things interesting, but the laws of physics in no way permit a planet to form 2 distinct types of crust under normal circumstances. There are hundreds of planetoids in this solar system alone. Most of them have solid crusts of rock or ice. Those other worlds effectively have a single type of crust that have roughly uniform densities because they are made of roughly uniform materials. Their crusts are what we should expect given the simple physics behind their development: light stuff floats, entropy tries to distribute everything evenly across the surface, the surface cools and hardens... There\'s geologic activity to keep it interesting, but there is nothing in the laws of physics that permits a planet, left unto its own accord, to form 2 types of crust so distinct in composition and density that one type of crust floats on another.\n\nKindly look at a sea floor (bathymetric) map of the Indian Ocean... India left tracks as it migrated north, away from Antarctica. The Chagos-Laccadive Ridge and the Ninty-East Ridge, they\'re tracks. That is unprecedented! Our continents are unique to all known planets and moons. There is nothing out there that remotely resembles the surface structure of this planet. It turns out we do occupy a special place in the cosmos.\n\nThere is also the question about the origin of plate tectonics. Where did that come from? Modern theory states tectonics arose long after the moon collision, after the entirety of the crust was destroyed. So there\'s new crust... -Brand new, cohesive unfractured crust. Okay, how did it get broken? What set off all this activity? Research leaves the impression the current theory isn\'t developed enough to address that inquiry.\n\nUm, what subduction? Planetary crust forms at nearly uniform density. Crust at roughly uniform density does not subduct. No subduction also means no migration. Even if an event happened to fracture the crust, individual plates would not move very far relative to another. There would be no wide sweeping actions relative to another as current theory implies. Thus, there is no collection technique. There would be no physical process to gather the volcanoes into larger masses. The process attributed to building up continents simply doesn\'t exist.\n\nThe moon formation simulations that show earth\'s crust being completely destroyed by the collision is contrary to the laws of physics as well. The footage looks great but the reality of the situation is rather different. The far side of the world got an earthquake and meteor shower. The crust exploding is pure Hollywood style sensationalism, not physics. Energy does not transmute in that fashion.\n\nThese inquiries become much easier to address from the Archaic Crust perspective; Earth didn\'t form 2 distinct types of crust, it forms only one type, known as ""sea floor"". The original crust had the lightest of materials so naturally Earth\'s crust is made of, more or less, the next lightest materials. ProtoEarth\'s crust was essentially floating on Earth\'s crustal material all along. Thus that unique feature of our world is neatly explained. The cause of the initial fracturing is obvious...\n\nSupporting evidence also includes Lake Baikal and the fault line that runs beneath the Mississippi River (New Madrid). Those features don\'t seem to have much association with global tectonics and are subsequently hard to explain in current contexts. On the other hand, they are easily understood in context of Archaic Crust Theory. There are consequences to forcing bent rock into a reduced arc. If you take half an egg shell and force it to adhere to the volume of an orange, you\'re gonna create a few fractures. A few of those original fractures include what separates North America from Siberia, the rift zone that houses Lake Baikal, and the New Madrid Fault line. The latter two don\'t contribute much to plate tectonics but all three are merely stress fractures that occurred while flattening out.\n\nAside from predicting everything we already know about our world, there is a less obscure fact predicted: we all know the continents kinda fit together. If you reduce the size of the globe they are plotted on they will fit together even better.\n\nThanks for taking the time to review Archaic Crust Theory.', 'The world is flat, dummy.', 'Forgive a harsh and scientific critique.\n\nThis reads a little like a first draft, like a jotting down of ideas.

324,382,Why INTJs are screwed up,"[""In my experience, INTJ and other xNTx with security instinct view relationships from the lens of Emotional Safety. INTJs fear reciprocal love which they see as the cause of emotional insecurity and will therefore go to great lengths to avoid it.\n\nINTJs also have an algebraic view of relationships. This causes them to set a mathematical value of themselves against which they evaluate potential partners in the dating scene which they view as a market. Armed with this mathematical self-value, the INTJ proceeds to find a mate but instead of settling for someone within their perceived value range as one would expect, INTJ instead prefer partners who are either way above their own level or way below it; never in-between.\n\nIn the first instance (partner is way above), INTJ feels safe because their logical mind tells them &quot;this equation does not balance, they will never love back&quot;. This allows the INTJ freedom to love their partner without dealing with the anxiety of the possibility of not being loved in return -- a form of idol worship. It also has the effect of indulging INTJ's, vanity and pride because by failing to realise that it is possible for their partner to love them inspite their shortcomings, they conclude that their initial formula was wrong and that\ntheir true value was much higher than previously thought. The high value partner sensing the conceit and rejection, pulls back thereby throwing INTJ back to their formulas &amp; calculations.\n\nIn the second instance (partner is way below), INTJ likewise feels safe because there is no fear of INTJ themselves loving. They freely bask in the love they receive from their &quot;lower&quot; partner without ever having to give anything back - not because they are mean-hearted but because doing so would result in the dreaded reciprocal love which INTJ is most afraid of.\n\nThe only way out of this viscous loop is:\n1) for INTJ to face their biggest fear, Reciprocal Love.\n2) to accept that in life not all things can be managed by equations.\n"", 'Having been in a long-term relationship with an INTJ, I can definitely see a lot of validity in this. They are far too sensitive to the power dynamics within a relationship for their own good and happiness.', ""Gosh I never thought I'd have sympathy for INTJs but this really makes me feel sorry for them."", 'Seriously.', 'just for laughs...', 'I\'ve pretty much only dated INTJs (until the partner I\'m with now). The whole calculative approach to reciprocating and receiving love is only true for the first few weeks/months. If you can stay with them long enough for them to feel safe and truly connected to you, they\'ll sacrifice anything to be with you and make things work. When it happens, it freaks them out and they experience a lot of inner turmoil because they can\'t justify why they\'re not depending on reason to make ""safer"" choices. So your reaction at this point can either make or break the relationship; if you react negatively, the INTJ won\'t trust themselves to make the same kind of sacrifices for you again.', ""One thing I've noticed is, of all types, INTJs seem to have the greatest variability in this realm. Some of us are simply asexual, antisocial and anti-emotionalism. Those that hail from this extreme are prone to build relationship out of calculation. It seems to me the original post best describes that end of the spectrum.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also very passionate INTJs. Of course, it seems all INTJs don't engage most of the world on an emotional level, so it would be hard to point out these types from afar, but they're out there. -Ones that feel deeply, intensely... Ones that thrive off intimacy and yearn for mutual, reciprocal love from a peer to such an extent that they could never accept the types of relationships outlined in the OP.\n\nI mean, I fully agree with the premise: INTJs are bound to be screwed up some way... lol But not all in that way."", ""Well I think that part of it stems from INTJs being so different from the mainstream expectations of intimacy and relationships that it's automatically assumed as negative. From a logical perspective, imagine having a significant other who is 100% trustworthy. Yeah they are human and might screw up from time to time, but there can't really be any questioning over the overall intent of being faithful and fully committed to the relationship, even when things are bad. That's a pretty high expectation to meet but I'm willing to bet that's what a lot of INTJs are looking for. Someone they know for sure will be there for them and understand them instead of being treated as some kind of weirdo that much of the rest of the world likes to treat people. Without the strong emotional skills that others have, INTJs turn to their own strengths and disconnect that part in their day to day interactions because it's too exhausting to open up especially to those who might stomp on it. It's really easy to perceive when you're being used and that's a really crappy feeling to have.\n\nI think it becomes more of an issue that INTJs look more at actions and not words and so for them to be comfortable with a relationship the actions have to be shown, not just talked about and that takes time.

That sounds more like a schizoid adaptation to intimacy than a logical undertaking of would we fit well together as partners.\n\nBeing so different from most of society, especially the generalized female role within it, I consider everything from an analytical perspective and include my personal experience with intimate relationships. For example I know that I do not tend to do well with idealistic personalities or those who do not accept my core functioning traits; i.e. they are an extrovert and therefore I am expected to conform regularly to large social engagements that please them.\n\nReciprocal love doesn't produce fear within me however, entrusting who I am both physically and emotionally is a deeply concerning endeavor to undertake. Particularly when you tend to be so frequently misunderstood within society. I also agree with mnadmin above me in that it is easy to perceive when you are being used and that does feel horrible. And rather disheartening as a human experience in general.\n\nAdd in any kind of societal perceived value for the way you might look and the tendency for many to initially chameleon their personality and preferences into what they perceive you want and it can make one inclined be more suspicious of what is initially presented to you as an INTJ.

325,383,A psychosomatically induced vision of God,"["";or an attempt at preseving a moment's stream of consciousness, in the form of incoherent rambling:\n\n\nI am sitting here at my desk at 9 in the evening. I whittled away my day as I would spend it: debating with others on the minutiae of life. Far from being a choleric, argument has always soothed my mind from the disquieting haunt of inactivity. There we are, on the internet, myself and anonymous people, jostling for the distinction that lend our words the name of truth. The sceptic may laugh, as Pontius Pilate does: what is truth? You will say that A is the cause of B, and therefore you have begun the plot to change the world. But from experience you will know that is it never as simple as that. How futile your attempts to understand ??to stretch your mind that it might engulf the universe, to understand all in the purity and perfection of all that there is to be understood. How inadequate your mind is to swallow reality, to generate causes and reasons from within yourself for the things that you do not know, and which will forever lie beyond your knowing. The mirages which appear to your intellect ??you call them reason, as you kneel slavishly before them, worshipping false gods so that you will have something to worship.\n\nAccording to the two most popular theories of death, we shall either know all after we die, or after we die, all becomes irrelevant. According to either doctrine, fighting over the truth is futile. In the one, we waste our energies on what will soon be revealed, and in the other, we waste our energies on what will never be resolved. Why then this absurd waste of time for something so futile?\n\nIn myself I see no answer for this question, beyond running to the idea that it is simply in my nature. It is written into me from the beginning, long before I knew to think, to long for truth, even as the beast longs for water. Somehow, out of the way I was created, I was born to long for a thing that I can never have, and which does not contribute to my prosperity in this life.\n\nYou will say: Ah, but truth is instrumental in this life: it informs us of opportunity and saves us from danger, it helps us attain happiness and helps us avoid misery. All this is true, but I cannot help thinking that I long for truth even after the utilitarian uses of it have been exhausted. If you were to come to me and tell me: here is the truth, but it will make you unhappy, I would take it. If you were to tell me: if you look at this truth, you will suffer injury and loss, I will look. If you told me: this truth is so dangerous, it will kill you, I will take death.\n\nWhy? Why, unless that thing is a thing whose value cannot be approached from any other value? It is a good which is sufficiently good without saying why. It is a thing perfect and pure in itself, and the justification for my wanting it lies simply in the nature of what it is, and in the nature of what I am. At the end of all values, motives, purposes, actions and thoughts, sits the supreme thing which is the reason for my being.

Much of her conversational ability is centered around small talk, conversation that is not necessary from my point of view. My daughter, an INFJ, in her 20s, and I text back and forth all day. We have a lot of great voice and text conversations. It\'s almost always analytical and theoretical. That\'s the conversation I like.\n\nIf I sense any conversation is intended to elicit an emotional response from me, I can\'t do it. My brain reacts in the opposite direction and any emotional display thereafter is insincere, which I can\'t bring myself to do. If you are forward with your intention, I respond so much better. For example, ""I\'m feeling a little needy today. Help!"" I respond to that kind of conversation so much better than, ""What are you doin\'?"" ""How was your day?"""" ..."" ""You sound busy. I didn\'t mean to bother you..."" I can figure out an action plan to help. I don\'t mind if you\'re emotional and need someone to talk to. Preface the conversation with it.

328,386,"What is ""spirituality""?","['How would you define it? How do you relate to it, if at all? How much importance does it have in your life? Is there anything about it that you feel is worth sharing with others?', 'now that is concise. to me its a feeling of connectedness, a oneness, we are the collective consciousness to the collective unconscious. we are the players on the stage, the pieces of the game. so lets have fun before the curtain draws or the lid goes on the box....', 'For me spirituality is a sense of higher purpose and meaning. Something that enriches my life beyond the mundane and seemingly meaningless everyday activities. Being a spiritual person reflects in my everyday life by the moments I stop to simply take joy in everything that surrounds me, by the feeling of connectedness I get when everything I experience in my day to day life seems to fall so perfectly in place :).\nI encourage everyone to develop their sense of spirituality so that they can feel this amazing joy and reassurance that comes from the certainty that everything has a meaning and a purpose. That life is not some random twist of faith and we are not some hopeless puppets roaming the Universe in a mad self destructive game.\nWhat about you Rift Zone ? What does being spiritual and spirituality mean to you ?\nTake care,\nVeronica\n', ""That's beautiful... Thank you both.\n\nI'm just an impartial witness here. I'm trying to understand all the nuances of spirituality, not contaminate the discussion with my thoughts on it. I suppose there's no harm in sharing I place a lot of value in spirituality, I have a strong personal relationship with it, and I'm inclined to agree with you guys."", 'Spirituality is an attempt at the self.\nSpirituality comes in many forms. Including sports, video games, art, music, science, & more\nSpirituality is being aware of spirit/energy/aura/vibes.\nSpirituality is realizing that things exist outside of physicality.\nSpirituality is realizing that you exist independent of your body.\nSpirituality is you. The viewer. The consciousness reading this.\nNot the eyes or the organs or the electrons moving through you, it is you, the observer.\nSpirituality is fun because it is an endless journey.\nThere is always more to learn and it can never be mastered.\n\nSpirituality is very important to me because it has changed my entire life!\n\n', 'I guess this is one way to describe it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A90xTuPbSa8&list=LLQ6JWYYmoAL1W8FA-7_1YyA&index=26', ""I like that Starve. Cool take on it.\n\nJune1, I really liked the video... until the last few moments of it. Then I couldn't help but to be reminded of what might be the most memorable of Matthew passages:\n\nMatthew 10:34-37\nDo not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law?”a man?™s enemies will be the members of his own household. Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.\n\nOverall I thought the vid and the spiritual implications were beautiful. Thanks for sharing it."", 'spirituality just like anyother word is a word invented out of logic and human intelligence to categorize things. as it is not a thing that can be explained, like how you feel about love hatred heat cold intuition etc associated with it. to me, it is to find our source. the source of life and this intelligence. to know oneself, realize oneself and become what created you (keeping aside evolution and big bang for now) is probably a bad interpretation of spirituality. pain and immense joy can definitely help in understanding it i believe', 'Yes, taken at the basic level, spirituality relates to the knowledge of some original ""self,"" which is divorced from the accidental traits of existence, either material or social. Spirit is the mind existing in a state of free will, and spirituality is a series of esoteric thoughts about the weirdness of that concept.', 'There are some great and very comprehensive answers on here already. My quick take is that spirituality, as far as people who describe themselves as ""spiritual"" means they adhere to something that is not of one of the major world religions, yet does agree there is something ""out there"" beyond the physical, something in the world, not just in us (or both); and that while it might be included in nameable religions, it doesn\'t really have a name.', ""The Now.\nBeing present for as much as possible, it's so powerful we can't stand it, so we turn to the future or the past and live there. How long can you hold it? How long can you stay with this present moment, this REALITY, before you jump ahead to the next possible pleasure, or look back to a memory that gives pleasure, or pain...?\nFor me Spirituality is being Present, being in The World is living in the past or future.... On the Court as it happens or in the stands, watching it happen as it WAS or how it IS TO BE"", ""I've come to think of spirituality the journey home. Home is the true self as defined by God/love/fate/the universe (whatever term works for you). It is a moment to moment practice of being with whatever thoughts/emotions come up, stilling them, and acting appropriately from a basis of love. We are all of love and thusly connected through it.

330,389,Qualified practitioners?,"[""Hi, I'm new here and still finding my way round. I've been a qualified MBTI practitioner since 1997, and I'm happy to be asked questions. How many practitioners are there among the members of this site - anybody know?"", ""Hi Chris. what is your wife's mbti, and being a long practitioner, what types do you seem to migrate to? And from?"", ""Hi, thank you for the questions! The first is easy - INTJ.\nThe second question I'm not so sure I understand - 'migrate to', 'migrate from'? Could you unpack those terms please?"", 'are there some types you dont get along with.', ""Ah, thanks for the clarification! I've spent a lot of my working life dealing with SJ's, so most of the time I can rub along with them OK (but might not choose their company, LOL!). I find very firm E's exciting but exhausting. Mid-life exploration has enabled me to draw pleasure from my less-preferred S side, while nearly dying of cancer in 2003 gave me an unwelcome confrontation with my F side!\n\nSo.... I suppose ESFJ would be my nightmare opposite in theory, but I say that with far less conviction than I would have done 10 years ago. Does that help?"", ""very much so, some people have an adverse effect on me, i seem to get along instantly with intp, intj, infp and infj's. but i'm new to this and I am finding it really fascinating. thank you for your insight."", ""Glad to help. Of your list, INTJs strike me as the 'hardest-edged' - but don't tell my wife I said so......!"", ""Hi ChrisP. Can you give me a legit free test so I can type myself accurately? I've taken multiple free tests; most say that I'm an ENFP, but some say that I'm an ENTP and even ISFP. I'm too broke to pay fifty bucks for the real test, but I still want to know what I am truly."", ""I don't know how many qualified practitioners are present. But here's a question; In your professional opinion. . . Why are NF's such faggots (Especially male INFJs)?\n\nI'm also curious what you think about other type tests, along with the instinct theory this site is based on. The only other two tests I'm aware of are Enneagram and socionics, unless you'll introduce me to more.\n\n"", ""Hi, TBNC... could you define 'faggot' please? I need to be sure I understand what you mean by the word (to avoid answering questions you may not be asking - LOL!)\n\nWhat do I think about other type tests? The professed origins of the Enneagram make me sceptical from the start, and I've not got it to 'work' for me yet: I've not encountered socionics. I'm familiar with Kiersey, which is similar to MBTI but not quite the same. I'd like to see the evidence base before commenting on this 'instinct theory'."", '', '', 'What is a practitioner? I know I could google it but...', 'In order to ensure MBTI is properly administered, the core materials are protected by copyright and only sold to people who have registered an accepted qualification in using it. This can be one of a clutch of broadly degree level psychology qualifications, or else a stand-alone certification (like I have). In the UK that certification depends on 100+ hours of guided reading, a four-day concentrated workshop process, an exam paper, a spell of supervised practice, then a final workshop day 6 months on. Does that answer the question?', 'HEY, CHRIS, NICE TO MEET AN INTP PRACTITIONER...\ni wish to change the world invent things,\ni have already invented alot of concepts and things which do make a huge impact on\nour world, like reducing greenhouses gases, improvement in transportation\nfarming and saving water and what not, but i dont have the energy to put that on\npaper and file it for patents.\n\nthis is where i just think i need support and think i am helpless\nventuring out in the unknown, how to change that, how to push\nmyself into being more extrovert and more business minded,\n\nand with my goals in mind whats the best possible type for me, in a relationship/marriage.\ni just wish to keep on inventing concepts and ideas all the time, for the rest of my life.\n\nmy second question to you is have you seen any intp-entj couples in your experience,\nis it a good pair? what are the typical problems arising from the couple?', ""Hello LWH, sorry to be slow to respond.\n\nTo be an inventor and change the world is a big aspiration. Don't forget, most of the world doesn't want to change! Start small - get one life-changing concept down on paper and persuade someone to take it on. Getting a job would be the best start if you haven't got one already, and will help you with the social skills etc you know you need, not to mention money to live on!\n\nThere's no ideal partner type to help you achieve your aims, and maybe you are looking at this the wrong way round? You know the old saying: 'love your wife, analyse your car - not the other way round!'\n\nYes - I've seen intp/entj partnerships, and they can do OK. Some problems can include - opposing needs for social activity and j's regarding p's as impractical. Sex life between two nt's tends to fade out rather easily.\n\nHope that helps!""]","['General Myers Briggs', 'Personality']",Personality

332,392,INTJ + ENFP,"[""I'm a bit of an informal fellow, so there's no need to bow. A salute will be adequate.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, as an INTJ we are likely to get along very well. You inspire, and I am inspired by the sheer depth of your understanding of the human condition. You feel things, and you show people like yours truly that it's okay to have feelings, as detrimental as feelings may be to us when we're outside of the laboratory. I'm relatively new, this is my first forum topic. So be gentle, senpais. I would like to add that I see all of you as potential friends, some of you as potential companions, and a few of you as potential victims. I can't entirely be sure who falls into what categories, and some of you may even fall into all three of them. Venn diagrams are cool. So from the other side of the MBTI pond, I just wanted to extend a firm robotic hand to you all as a gesture of kindness, because that seems like the sort of thing a person would do. As for those of you who will become one of my (or our) potential victims/test subjects, it's not all bad. You could end up with some really cool super-powers. Stay positive.\n\n- Me"", 'A stranger...from the outside. Ooooh.', ""Your personality is showing.\nIt's some good shit though, it really is.\nDo you come with a remote?"", ""Oh god. There are people here.\n\nI have a remote and a joystick. Both have an interesting, but limited user interface, but for $10 you can have full access. Enjoy the double entendre. The only thing I could really use is a self-destruct button, and in a perfect world I'd be able to detonate myself and cover people in candy and glitter. It's not the most effective use of transhumanist technologies, but it'd fill my little robotic heart with joy, and possibly cause PTSD by glitter. Some men just want to watch the world burn.\n\nI'm trying with the personality thing. Sometimes I'm hilarious. Sometimes I derp. Sometimes it's a combination of the two."", ""IMO, an INTJ + ENFP relationship can either be an explosive, torturous disaster (leaving both sides emotionally crippled for a long period of time, lol) or an out-of-the-world, unbelievably fantastic experience.\n\nI've dated INTJs and non-INTJs. In terms of the beginning stages of a relationship, the latter just doesn't even begin to compare. That initial spark is so fucking magical; you feel electrified, hopelessly absorbed, hungrily intrigued."", ""I think ENFPs really hold a special place for INTJs in their hearts. When I first meet someone who types as INTJ, I can sense it within the first five minutes of conversation. I feel unexplainably drawn to this person, like there's just SOMETHING about him that makes me want to GTFO the party and sit down somewhere quiet, just so I can listen to him better.\n\nENFPs are so social that flirting is kind of a joke. When a new guy hits on me, I usually find it really superficial and dull so I fuck with him until he goes away. But an INTJ is smart enough to tease me back and genuinely make me laugh.\n\nOh god, I can't put the feeling into words. It's just this amazing, breathless FEELING I can't explain. But in the moment, both INTJ and ENFP know it's there, and they know that the other can feel it just as strongly as they themselves. Once you get a taste of it you're never going to forget what it's like. But in the end, it's a very high-risk relationship because the passion and energy is going to run high. It'll probably peak and decline continuously if both parties aren't balanced."", ""INTJ's = bomb.com"", 'I was in a relationship an ENFP several years ago and it was funny because she constantly tried to tease me from the outset. Example: ""Your hair is blonde."" I say no and take out my driver\'s license and show her that it says brown. She just gives me this look of \'you\'ve gotta be kidding me\'. I then proceeded to give her an explanation of how the lighting made my hair appear blonde instead of a lighter brown. Her expression said it all.\n\nENFPs are so fun to tease back because they think they\'re so clever. Good times.', 'This post should be made into a poster on every INTJ\'s door or wall or wherever. Thank you for writing and sharing this. Or maybe I\'ll just put this on ""business cards"" and give them out to prospective ENFPs or other suitors... Something like that.', ""I'm an INTJ too, TR, so don't take offense. Only our type would use a driver's license as evidence of hair color. We would prefer that because it is documented evidence of self-reported information, not mere heresay. We're the best and have papers to prove it. We authored the proof ourselves.~Don"", ""I'm an INTJ too, TR, so don't take offense. Only our type would use a driver's license as evidence of hair color.

We authored the proof ourselves.~Don"", ""I just want to that I find people- definitely intj inclusive to be super intriguing. I like to open up people's brains and get a taste in a non zombie way. I love to know how people think! The harder the process the more satisfying it is for me. No, that's not right... Anyway, I can see why there's a thing between INTJ's and ENFP's. They have fun brains! I can't wait to sample other people's minds as well."", 'The continuous ""peak and decline"" is where I run into trouble. I tend to get impatient after the first two or three cycles and start losing my emotional grip. Above all I\'m looking for stability, and that\'s just not part of the equation with ENFPs it would seem. Still, it\'s an intoxicating and addicting experience, while it lasts. Maybe I just need to hang back and wait, and stop trying to plan things out in my relationships. The biggest lesson I\'ve learned with ENFPs is that they aren\'t the biggest fans of being a part of someone else\'s plan... :P', ""I don't really agree with that statement as ENFP's are usually the ones who settle for nothing less than the ultimate. Long term relationships are #gold and I wouldn't even date without a possible end game in mind. Not the creepy name the kids on the first date type but the actively searching for a lifelong companion who absolutely gets me is like the second most important thing in my life. 'Peak and decline' I would like to think of as 'can't get enough and I still love you but need space.' I call it turtleing. You need to be alone in your shell for a while or you'll break apart from overdose. As for plans, as long as I can help make them, its all systems go! @JeremiahMabry. :)"", 'Used to be married to an ENFP. When it was good, it was great. But when it was bad, it was really bad....', ""I've never read such shite in all my life. If you were truly am INTJ then you'd have analysed the situation and already come to a firm and rational conclusion as to who are friends, companions and victims. And you would present your findings in the most succinct way possible nothing more and nothing less - most definitely served without a pointless small-talk word salad about bowing, saluting and smalltalk.\n\nCan somebody switch him off?"", 'We\'re you an INTJ you\'d be aware of the fact that the MBTI result a person gets doesn\'t define every aspect of the person, that criticizing apparently doesn\'t involve critical thinking where you\'re concerned, and be aware of the fact that the MBTI is the non-criminal equivalent of criminal profiling. It has its merits, but it\'s far from perfect. You would also be aware that not all people with the same MBTI results are copies of each other, and furthermore not all information about a person can be deduced from simply observing them. If you can walk into a room full of a hundred people and within 30 seconds think you know everything about every person in the room, and define who your friends, companions, and victims are, then you\'re engaging in the variety of criticism known as ""foolish criticism"". Unless there are external factors such as walking into a Neo-Nazi or Jihadist gathering, you\'re probably not going to be able to figure all of that out in a manner of seconds. The only logical explanation for considering this ""shite"", would be either you don\'t read often or you didn\'t read your own comment. So pretty please, with a fucking cherry on top, don\'t be a tard. I\'d also assume that you knew INTJs tend to be sarcastic, and if you weren\'t able to understand that a fair amount of the post was sarcastic, maybe you should rethink your MBTI result instead of going Lord of the Autists on here. I\'d even go so far as to propose another MBTI category just for you: DMFR. If you haven\'t fried what\'s left of your brain huffing paint thinner or burning a hole through your skull with the titular ""lasers"" from your handle, I\'m sure you could figure out what that stands for. But considering who you are, that might be a bit of a stretch. And surely you know INTJs don\'t tend to believe in miracles. Try again.', ""Riiigggght. The succinct part seems to be lost on you. Must you use 50 words when 2 would suffice? I've never read so much drivel."", ""The part about INTJs being able to be verbose is lost on you, as was everything else. I know for a fact I'm more introverted than your Cliffnotes intellectual self. My reading choices and most of what I do falls in line with what INTJs tend to do, but the fact that I write more than the average person is the only issue you have? Get a hobby, pick up a book, something. It isn't my fault nobody wants to touch your whiny ass."", ""INTJs don't read or consume knowledge without purpose. INTPs do - they seek to learn as much as possible. INTJs have a end game. A problem to solve, a system to build. They consume knowledge to further that aim and only as much of each topic as required.\n\nMaybe you just need your Ritalin dosage increased?"", 'Or instead of assuming I read everything for the sake of reading about it, my reading material serves the purpose of bettering my current academic output, and future professional output. Aside from a few topics that are only loosely linked to what I would like to become, the rest serves the purpose of being in-depth quality input so that I may produce quality output. I\'m sure even your little hobbit self can appreciate working towards having encyclopedic knowledge of a field you plan on getting into.\n\nThat being said there are a number of sites that state INTJs have a thirst for knowledge, and a few that say INTJs read all they can. Some say INTPs acquire knowledge for the sake of knowledge.\n\nBased on our little back-and-forth that I hope goes on for at least a year or two, I\'d say "" the pipe"" was making a comeback in the UK.', 'Wow I think the Ritalin worked. A normal message without the word salad bullshit.

Carl Jung had a fairly sophisticated understanding of neuroticism which he explicitly excluded from behaviors of his non-neurotic archetypes. Interestingly, this point is borne out by modern analysis of MBTI vs. the Big Five. In my experience, neuroticism (which, let\'s face it, is fairly common) almost always results in assignment of the wrong MBTI types.\n\n5) As an INTP, I find myself naturally drawn to INFPs and INFJs (but what do I know about what\'s good for me?)', ""Soloread, interesting points. Others have suggested that the preference graph is indeed a scale, which it does appear to be, but that is needlessly complex and implies that INTPs least preferred function is N, when I would consider that to be the most preferred function.

Mechanical reproduction is substantially less accurate, which is usually linked to this type?™s relative weakness when it comes to remembering material with poor logical flow. On top of this, they are capable of highly accurate recollection of visual information that lacks logical flow, if it was received under intensely focused attention. For example, INTJs can reproduce many details of the rapidly changing scenery when driving in a car. This seems to be related to the fact that they are shutting off the reflection process when taking in the information.&quot;\n\nI noticed I do that a lot. I tend to get into situations at work and other places. Where the person is not an INTJ.

Nothing ever fits together properly. I never sound as intelligent as I know I am. It frustrates me to no end that I can work inside these incredibly sophisticated seemingly heuristic/intuitive systems and never actually convey them properly to someone else.\n\nMost of the time people can tell that I know what I\'m talking about because I can put it into practice and they see the \'practical\' results of what\'s going on in my mind.\n\nI\'m young...I haven\'t been able to overcome this. Only by putting whatever mental framework I have into practice, can be people understand where I\'m coming from...and even then, they have to be smart enough to follow it.\n\nI think some of that has to do with the fact that we are very conceptual thinkers.

I tend to see the big picture, but when trying to convey the idea, I spit out details and forget to connect the dots for people.

It's very painful but it requires that every possible branch be explored and dragged to a logical conclusion. The result was that I found myself able to explain complex technical issues to non-technical people. This is a tremendious advantage in large corporations. Any young INTJ considering career options should consider these kinds of jobs (imagine being the subject matter expert in the development of robotics). You might find this kind of career a great use of your unique talents.

I feel like the INTJ's ability to quickly jump to a conclusion (through intuitive mechanisms) is a double-edged sword for this reason - and sometimes our intuition produces incorrect results too.\nI guess what I'm saying is, I agree with Don and Andrea. Planning out a logical flow to what you need to communicate is one of the best things and INTJ can do for clarity.

If its cool I'll put my INFP 2 cents in.\nI agree with DukeLeto that a disaster of some kind would only be temporary. Look at 9-11, that was great to start a war, but it also started a massive amount of hate towards a smaller group. Which caused its own problems (?Solutions?), humans irrationally look to blame someone for bad things happening.\n\nFalkaiarhel, you bring up a good point about people's refusal to change. Is that mostly ignorance though? Look at the vaccination fight that some moms are having, again pointing to the irrational blame, its mostly just ignorance on the mom's part.\n\nAlso as far as resources go\nChanges in Farming could be implemented across the globe, look at aquaponic type farming. There is a Denver farm that takes up 3200 sq ft that uses aquaponics and puts out more produce in a year than most 20 acre farms in the area, not to mention the fish they also produce. ( You INTJ's might have to check my stats on that )\nSo we could easily do away with hundreds and hundreds of acres of farm land, giving that back to natural biomes with a change in how we grow food.Again I think the reason most of this hasn't caught on is ignorance.\n\nChanges like this can already be seen throughout in small pockets and needs to be brought up and used with disposable materials. Say instead of Styrofoam cups and plates, make them with the more biodegradable materials like bamboo, and plant fibers. Things like cow farms making degradable planters from manure waste, needs to be more normal.\n\nJust a question for you INTJ's, yes there are some stupid people out there (the ones that can't learn no matter what you teach them), but is most of the rest of the population just ignorant? So to question some of your statements TooGeek2bChic, would the change in a person's persona caused by gaining more information on a subject they were ignorant to necessarily be removing their free will? They'd ultimately have to decide on what to choose after that of course.\n\nI also like the idea DukeLeto put forward of a networked Collective mind. This is fantastic, but should also initially be developed with an AI Counter part, a sort of weights and balances measure, also to keep things on topic. The collective could also confer with other more rudimentary groups say local or regional government houses to also put forth their ideas. As a collective would be able to deliberate and decide on things much quicker, having a secondary check's and balance with the local/regional governments would hopefully make things between a collective and non collective people much more collaborative. While the non collective (basic's maybe?) people deliberate the collective can easily work on other things.\n\nThe collective mind should also be a choice, to keep free will a thing. Say a process much like the Amish do with their children. They are away and disconnected from the collective until say their 18th Birthday, at that point they should be given a choice as to whether they want to join the collective. If they don't no big deal, this would hopefully stop the war of individuals vs collective.\n\nPointing to part of this, a Neural Link of some sort is kind of paramount, this technology would open up so many avenues. I believe it will be the only way we can really create a true AI. A network system would need to be setup to work at neural speeds, say locally first then progressively outward into the Internet. Implementation of a neural link, say getting data directly from the base of the skull and start of the spine, would also have to be developed simultaneously.\n\nAll of this would ultimately boil down to, collaboration and less ignorance. Which could be helped with a change in our teaching standards. Say kids by 6th grade need to be able to do algebra (without a calculator) and by senior year of high school need to learn at minimum 3 languages fluently. Students need to be separated out based on how they learn, and taught by teachers that can adequately use that learning style, instead of just lumping them all together. We should even setup a Global Teaching standard, that would be suggested to follow.\n\nUltimately, everything about our daily lives needs to be changed. Transportation, medicine, teaching, engineering, waste processing, energy management, etc, etc. I think at a certain point monetary systems need to be dealt away with, but that's way way in the future.\nI don't know, poke holes and all.\n"", ""I'm not sure why everyone is ignoring the most import part of my postulate. Our worldwide population has been growing exponentially for at least a hundred years now. Do you really think that all of these farming and livestock innovations are going to fix that? Most religions view birth control as an afront to God's will. Your suggestions would be a good start for enabling us to expand beyond earth but anything short of that is just buying us more time in my opinion. Less ignorance in the world would be a good thing of course but we can only lead the ignorant to water, we can't make them drink without taking away free will. I think it's a huge mistake to assume educating the ignorant will suddenly make them more responsible citizens. Much of what we do as a species doesn't come from rational thought or logic, it comes from deep seeded emotions that often trump logic and sabotage our future in the process. Creating a new world order with a centralized government to think for us isn't going to bode well for free thinkers and anyone else that doesn't fall in line. If any of you haven't already read the book 1984 by Orson Wells I suggest you do so. That is probably the most likely outcome for some of the ideas that have been mentioned here. Steamtech and Duke Leto, both of you are vastly underestimating the power of human greed and corruption. The solutions you are suggesting would be the perfect platform for the corrupt that are currently in power to further abuse that power and subjugate everyone else. I don't know, maybe that's what it will take to save us from destroying ourselves."", 'Also, it\'s funny that you would bring up the Amish Ramshpringa as an example of the ""freedom of choice"" they supposedly give their young. I\'m guessing you are unaware of the consequences they face when they choose to leave the Amish lifestyle. Basically they are completely banished from the community including their own family and they are never allowed to return........ I have little doubt people would face the same predicament in your scenarios.', ""I brought up the Amish Ramshpringa, because it is freedom of choice. The consequences are simply that, consequences. If you choose to drink 150 bottles of beer at once, you can do that feel free, however the consequences that come from that are purely a result of your choice, not anyone else's.\n\nThe same can be said for immigrants coming to America for the first time, or Jehovah's witnesses if they choose not to believe in that religion (who also get banished like the amish), or a multitude of other instances. How the person deals with the consequences of their choice is purely up to them.\n\nNow as far as over-population, that's where having a neural link and eventually full on virtual environment will come in handy to a certain extent. At a certain point after that technology is made, there will be advancements in virtual reality, and at some point down the road, people will choose to be completely removed from reality and basically become a brain in a jar connected to the Internet.\n\nThis will quell some of the over population issues, but not all of them. Assisted suicide, needs to be more common place, despite what others believe there is going to be a certain amount of the population that just doesn't want to live, it needs to become acceptable.\n\nFor additional things maybe bring back Greek style games for lifetime inmates, or make reproduction limited to only those with a license. Personally I believe that a large government is a bad thing, and don't suggest it at all. Breaking governments down into more local or area type sections might help, but to make anything change you need to be able to administrate it some how.\nEither way no matter what you do, you're going to be taking away someones freedoms for some reason or another, in some way shape or form. Think of alcohol when it was outlawed, did it help things?\n\nGreed and corruption, are everywhere, its kind of how Humanity has always been. Its in certain peoples nature, now can we somehow find out what causes it and treat it like an illness? Maybe, maybe not. Or rather treat it like a disease and burn it? Doubt it, greed and corruption started more and more with the advancement of both monetary systems and single seats of power, i.e. monarch, noble, lord of a land, president, pope, etc. The further and further we get away from having to purely survive, the more this pops up. The ideal of &quot;I'm not as comfortable as so and so, I'm going to take what he has&quot; will always be prevalent.\n\nWith a gradual shift in ideals, maybe people would find personal accomplishment to be better than sex, eventually. Then maybe, just maybe we'll see less greed and less corruption, but I highly doubt it. Small shifts like this can be seen already in some larger cities, like Tokyo, part of that is the acceptance of suicide, and the other part is that some people don't need sex to be happy. Their population has started to drop rapidly over the last few years.\n\nLike you said you can bring the ignorant to water but can't make them drink, then let them die. Its a simple fact of life, we are born, and we die, the only thing that matters is our experience whether its remember by others or not. You can't save everyone on a sinking ship, but the ones that wish to survive will do the best they can to make their own way.\n\nRight now Humanity is nothing more than a frog in a pot which is being brought up to a boil. Without a shift in how people view things, this won't change. (And yes I know the frog thing is a myth, sadly its also a really good comparison to just how some people are)\n\nMay seem heartless, but it is what it is."", ""I agree wholeheartedly that very difficult changes will have to be made and there will be a huge price to pay for future generations. I'm just pointing out that the more radical the changes are the more likely it won't happen. If it does happen the way you propose, we will most certainly loose some of our humanity in the process. You are absolutely right that there will be consequences but those consequences are nothing more than choices other people decided to enforce in order to elicit the desired response (staying in the Amish lifestyle). Life will always be a struggle and there is no doubt that we will have to adapt or die. The question is..... will there be enough grains of sand in the hourglass of time for us to realize and achieve any of these potential solutions before it's too late? The stuff you guys are suggesting is so radical compared to what we have now it's extremely difficult to imagine humanity as a whole embracing it..... even if it's a matter of our own survival. However, it has to start somewhere and having candid conversations like this is as good a place as any. Now we just need to figure out how to get the rest of the population aware and engaged. :-)"", ""I believe this shift has already been happening for quite a while. Look at the vegan movement, although it seems to have only recently been gaining ground to some, its been around since the early 30's. Although Veganism is kind of a radical way of looking at things, the dietary benefits from a slightly more vegetarian life style can already be seen hitting most of the coasts.\n\nThe same can be said for development in AI, most Americans grow up with big blockbuster movies about how AI is bad and that it will end us, ah la Terminator and the like. However most of the rest of the world is very active in its development. Japan has many corporations dedicated to development of advanced robotics and AI learning algorithms, same goes with Russia, Germany, and France. There are startups in the US, but they are only growing slowly out of California and some companies out of the East coast.\n\nNeural developments are already being worked on, I don't know of the progress outside the US, but many of the things I see so far have been for amputee's. There is even a dedicated group of neuroscientists that want to have the human brain capable of interfacing with the Internet by 2045.\n\nOn top of the Aquaponics farming, Algae as a resource is being developed heavily in Arizona. The algae is being developed to be used for replacements for sugar, oil, starches, fuels, fertilizer etc.\n\nMany of these technologies and advancements are already there, much like a puzzle dumped out straight from the box. Just no one's put all the pieces together yet.\n\n==On a side note, but still on topic==\nThere is an idea that I've wanted to try for a long time, one of which would require a lot of funding to start out, and a lot of planning. Basically take modern civilization and cut it into pieces. These pieces become the lego bricks of a fully self sustaining city.\nWhats the basic necessities for human's, Food, Shelter, Water, say electricity for lighting and heating and communication.\n\nSolar and Wind are great to start out with for power, but other sources of power generation will need to be looked into, like the power generation from ionized particles in the air (company doing research currently in new york), or generating power from large compressed air resevoir (company in germany currently researching this). Mix generating technologies with currently developing battery technologies (look up Hot battery for grid storage), and you have renewable energy sources. (Currently there are several companies look at how to create cheaper and higher effeciency solar panels with less harsh waste products)\n\nThen you throw in food growing techniques like aquaponics, and recycling foods through composting or creating other materials from the waste. Add in a healthy supply of bamboo, which is fast growing (and grows in majority of the temperature zones) and you've not only got decent flooring but cooking utensils, cups, scaffolding, piping you name it.\n\nThen all you need is the buildings and people to build them. There are many homeless and wandering people, some of them would be good for this project. They would appreciate a good meal, and also would probably be greatful for a house to call their own. Using bamboo, as scaffolding, you could easily erect dirt based housing, (lookup dirtbag homes), make each person build or help build their own homes from the ground up. Normally people want homes of 1200sq/ft or higher, but most people don't need that. I know a lot of people that live in 600sq/ft or less, add in ceiling heights of up to 12ft, and you can easily put lofts and kitchenettes etc, use composting toilets and you don't have to worry to much about some of the waste.\n\nDirtbag style homes usually have 1.5ft to 3ft thick walls, which means absolutely perfect insulation for most temperature zones. Figure out how to make glass in that kind of environment and you could easily start creating dual pane gas sealed windows for use in the homes. Inside the houses temperatures can be maintained by passing air inside the house through a 9-12 foot U in the ground, normal temperate areas 9ft-12ft into the ground the ground regulates its temperature, often being cooler in the summers and warmer in the winters. (double check that i could be off a bit) You mix that with heating techniques like Rocket Mass heaters, and you can live pretty comfortably.\n\nIts an idea that I've been contemplating for a long time, it just needs further thought. Things like waster reclamation and water reprocessing needs to be taken into account. Resources for running both water and electricity also need to be considered.\nJust an idea for now though. Puzzle piece kind of idea."", ""Well all the things you mention are nice ideas except for the fact that they are not currently profitable and we both know it won't happen on a global scale unless there is a profit to be made. I am a class1 wastewater treatment plant operator so I'm very familiar with the sciences involved in some of these endeavors. Germany is leading the world in green tech and even they are lightyears away from some of the things you discuss. I'm not saying these things aren't possible. .... just much easier said than done. Eventually we will have no choice but as of right now we can't even get a lot of people to agree that global warming is real much less do something significant about it. You are describing some Utopian society where everyone works together for the common good but we are so far away from that it's laughable."", ""Yep INFP, idealist to the very core. :(\n\nThe civilization starter idea that I mentioned before, would be the experiment to see if it works. Just like dollar bills when they were first introduced, people won't have any faith in it until its proven to work."", ""I wish more people were idealist, including myself sometimes frankly, but I'm an INTJ so that makes me more of a realist almost by default. :-(\n\nI thank you for your input because there are definitely some good ideas there. I'm feeling a little cynical about humanity right now (obviously) but I still hope we can survive our own stupidity long enough to figure this stuff out. ;-)"", 'Being a realist is important though, idealists like me give you the idea, you shoot it down, but secretly start to wonder if that would work.\n\nMaybe down the line you will discuss it with someone else as a side note, an engineer, a plumber, a geologist whoever. The more you discuss it, the more facts you collect and more data you can gather, all the while repeating the cycle, idea - shoot down - revitalize idea. Basically breaking the idea into smaller and smaller more achievable parts.\n\nIts a snowball effect. Or maybe its my idealism again, but the theory is sound.', 'No Malthusians here? ;-)\n\nYour opening post took the million-year view. From that perspective, an optimistic expectation might be that homo sapiens is not the endpoint of evolution. That raises the question of what it means to be human, though. I\'d suggest that any line of thought that refers to ""the masses"" is unlikely to be constructive. Good luck, just the same.\n\nFor me, one of the central lessons of personality theory is this: there are (at least) 16 kinds of normal (...with all that that implies for evolutionary advantage) -- even those I can\'t stand.', ""I have to admit I've never heard of Malthus until now but I guess I managed to come to some of the same conclusions on my own. I used the million year bench mark because I believe there are only a small handful of ways we could possibly make it that long without destroying our planet and ourselves in the process (given our current trajectory)."", 'My college years (and a few thereafter) were spent reading many of the works now described at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian as part of the ""neo-Malthusian"" revival -- and, of course, Brave New World.\n\nBut Malthus got it wrong -- as did Paul Ehrlich, Dennis Meadows, The Club of Rome, and many other very smart guys. Their concerns were not unfounded, but what can we learn from their errors?', ""I'm not familiar with their work so you will have to tell me what you believe their mistakes were."", ""It's a huge body of work in which I am less than expert and for which there would be no room here in any case.

I don\'t know if this is legitimately an intj thing, but I\'m convinced it is. I think it\'s human nature to try to own distinct characteristics that set one apart from others and create a feeling of uniqueness, but there may be something to this. I\'ve had countless experiences with people commenting on how serious/intense I look. A couple funny stories that are just from the last year: I was at a wedding and I was staring at an attractive woman serving food who was far away and my little brother happened to walk past her and say something flirty which got a laugh from her. When he came back to the table he said ""she\'s going to bring the food to our table next, I just told her we are seated over there at the table where the creepy dude is staring at you."" I was pissed off and embarrassed, because I was definitely in a daze when staring, probably thinking about something random.\nAlso, Jeremiah, I have a walmart story. I was recently walking down an aisle looking for breakfast food or something, and a lady walks in front of me out of nowhere and says ""smile!"" because apparently I had an intense cereal searching stare that she didn\'t like.

351,412,Job - Whats yours? Whats most common for INFP?,"[""Question to all my fellow INFP, what job do you hold? Do you enjoy it to its fullest? And if you could change, what would focus on instead?\n\nHere are my answers to my own questions:\nMy Current job, I'm a Computer Technician/Help Desk Operator for a school district. During the year this job is mostly fulfilling, but can turn quite rapidly between intra-department drama and angry people on the phone. So at times I enjoy this job, and most of the rest of the time it is stressful and unfulfilling, especially during summer, yes I have to work the entire summer, which for a Help desk operator everything goes dead quiet.\nI've been here for 5 years now, I don't think it would be so bad if I had a window in my office, but I'm more or less in an office that was carved out of part of the server room, it's always cold. Majority of my co-workers have to switch out during the school year helping on the 2nd help desk chair, as you can imagine most of them do not enjoy this, and most of them are not adverse to making that known to me and every person that walks down the hall. As an INFP, this is probably where most of my daily stress comes from. Anyway..\n\nMy dream job:\nI have found that I have an unrequited love for both making things, technology and space. So a while back I decided to try and make my own satellite. My dream job would be to do that all the time, its a mix of different things and as we INFPs know it's difficult to focus on one hobby at a time. This hobby lets me do multiple things all at once, between creating my own circuit boards, programming, to machining and forging parts. As it is just my brother and I working on this project we've had to create a bunch of things from scratch. So if I get bored of programming, might as well start a 3d print for some parts that need to be made for the engine, or the printer is printing so I might as well read up on orbital mechanics and try to understand that further. See the allure?\n"", 'First of all hello.\n\nTo answer your question I am a social worker with a concentration in Urban Leader ship. Absolutely LOVE what i do. If I wasn\'t a social worker I would probably be an Anthropologist, Ethnography, The psychology of Culture, Pilot, Foreign relations fill in the blank, International social worker. I turned out to be a social worker with a concentration in Urban Leadership. I still want to explore other things so the curiosity and search continues since iam always growing up aka trying to figure out explore and/or improve myself . I think that is the key to being happy, that\'s why children are so happy, because they do it all the time, and as we grow older "" society makes you feel as if you have to settle for something, and gain material possessions, instead of personal joy"", I don\'t know my two cents', ""yes I would say I enjoy both of my jobs very much. I am currently a lifeguard during the summer and a haunted house actor in the fall. I enjoy lifeguarding because it helps me feel like what I do matters and that I can make a difference, plus I guess its a whole power and responsibility thing I feel a sense of duty to help wherever I can in little and small ways and it feels good to know that I can even be there to help people in life or death scenarios if need be. as for the haunted house, well... that's just fun, I mean who hasn't gotten a kick out of scaring someone from time to time right? although interestingly enough as far as the normal work day goes being a life guard and a haunted house actor aren't that different except for one thing, I mean for both jobs you pretty much just wait around for something to happen but have to remain very vigilant and react to people and situations quickly and appropriately, but the difference is for one job you get paid to scare the crap out of customers but at the other job you get paid to have the customers scare the crap out of you.\n\nnow if I had to choose another job I would definitely want to either be a practicing psychologist where I could have one on one conversations with people and help them work through their problems or a political activist (if that counts as a job title) because I have some big ideas on how to change the world for the better"", ""@Verouscka and @AshtonPacker Thanks for your input, from what I've been able to read a lot of INFP's are in some sort of civil service, like social working and counseling, basically anything that means helping people. I'm don't think my job fits into that category that well, but I guess its similar. I think I need a change in job ;)\nI have also thought about going backpacking for a year, but who doesn't right.\n"", 'lol IDK sounds close with your help desking and your passion for tech. It seems all INFPs really want to do is something they have a passion for, and mixing that with people somehow makes it meaningful...\n\nPersonally after doing a lot of things its taken 30 years on this planet to commit to working on my BA for social work. Im pretty interested in people in general sociology, neuroscience, anthropology, cognitive science/psychology, things of that sort- All my classes pretty much are thing Iv already independently studied or am interested in, Im just pissed that it didnt even enter my awareness until I was 27, In high school everyone was shoving IT at me, I see the logic in the $$$ and a BA for a job that dont pay much is crazy but I never cared about that, I resent that it was taken off the table on me, but then again Iv accrued a lot of real life experience in the meantime lol', ""finished a bachelor of economics at age 19-20, worked in that area for a couple of months, after that until now (im 27) I have done a variety of small jobs just to get by admin, data entry, call centre. I've studied psychology and spiritual healing courses (but never finished). As of right now I have no idea what i want to do, im pretty content not having much money and just observing people all day.\nThey do say INFPs have the most difficulty in finding a career."", '', '', ""My own dilemma: I am majoring, and love Hospitality Management(Hotels/restaurants/event coordinating). With this I was planning to start a quick service restaurant to employ people who need a second chance. I am physically weak, 4'10'', and have a bad genetic medical history. Therefore, I don't know how well my body can handle the next 20/30 years in a restaurant. I test ENFP and INFP, depending on the day. I absolutely love counseling, and body language to an equivalent. Also, I wonder if being in a leadership role will be bad for me mentally. Another thing, will being in a fast-paced environment prevent the switching job pattern we have as INFPs, do you think? What do y'all think I should do? Or do you think I should just dive into all of my interests, and become the CEO of six businesses at the same time like one of my professors? lol, I would really appreciate your comments. <3"", ""Currently I'm a electronic security technician. I drive around 50% of the day and listen to podcasts, 40% thoughtless troubleshooting, 5% video games on my phone while waiting on hold, and 5% of troubleshooting that actually takes some thought process, which is honestly the only part I truely enjoy.\n\nIt pays well though which allows me to buy the tools and material I need for woodworking and all the ingredients I need to make fancy food.\n\nThe only job I can currently think about that would make me truly happy was if I was a personal chef for someone who liked to explore new foods. I have absolutely no formal training of any type concerning food prep though so I'll just have to be content with making yummy stuff for myself."", ""I am a parts manager. Well I have no employees under me so I mainly manage my self, but I do run the entire parts/sales department at a small airport.\n\nI've worked as a mechanic and that was great for a little while till I got utterly bored.

I have issues coming up with a steady stream of creative ideas.\n\nI think most jobs that are flexible with changing tasks/environments that offer the INFP the ability to put their own personal touch into their work would be a good candidate.\n\n""]","['Romantics ', 'Personality', 'INFP - Healer']",INFP - Healer

353,414,On the cusp,"['Many people report test results that put them ""on the cusp"" between E and I, between P and J, or to a lesser extent between T and F. It is possible that this is so, but generally this is nÌ²oÌ²tÌ² what the tests are telling you.\n\nMBTI is set up to assign one letter and one letter only within each dichotomy (e.g., E/I.) The questions are based on a statistical scheme called Item Response Theory (IRT.) IRT has important implications for our understanding of the percentages that come with some test results.\n\nIn brief, the percentages are confidence levels for the tests rather than effect sizes for the test takers. If you had a score of 50% E (though the mathematics prevents that particular number from actually coming up) it would nÌ²oÌ²tÌ² mean that you are ""evenly balanced"" on introversion and extroversion. It would mean that this set of test questions could not discern your E/I preference. A score of 90% would mean that ""we\'re 90% sure that this set of test questions has correctly assigned your single type."" See the problem?\n\nA related problem is test reliability. If you take the test repeately, sometimes coming up E and sometimes coming up I, it does nÌ²oÌ²tÌ² mean that you are ""evenly balanced"" between E and I. It means that this test fails to produce reliable results.\n\nThere is a lot of published material on these matters, which we can add to this forum if people are interested.\n\nIn general, rather than focusing on getting the type just right, I find it more helpful to think about Type Dynamics. Starting with an assumption that we all have and use all eight function attitudes (e.g. introverted intuition) but in different situations and at different times in our lives, we can can focus on which function would work best for us at any particular moment.', 'I negelcted to mention that changing one letter can make a big (and often implausible) difference in the Jungian function stack. P?”J interchanges Dominant with Auxilliary, Tertiary with Inferior, and aÌ²lÌ²sÌ²oÌ² reverses the attitude of every function. The results are not ""almost alike."" Flipping N?”S or F?”T in the middle dichotomies may exchange Dominant for Inferior or Auxillary for Tertiary, and always changes their attitudes. Flipping I?”E actually makes the smallest difference, in my view. It interchanges Dominant with Auxilliary and Tertiary with Inferior but does not alter function attitudes. Most people understand that I?”E is not inconsequential, so imagine all of the others being worse.', 'Hi Soloread, thanks for this interesting post. I have a question about interpreting the following figures: http://curiosophy.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/function.jpg\n\nIn my mind, each function ""oval"" is like an electron orbital -- at any given point in time a person\'s degree of usage of a function may fall anywhere within the cloud (colored oval) of interest. Is this a correct interpretation, or is it not possible to ""function flip,"" as you put it?\n\nThanks in advance.', 'I am familiar with this graphic and I generally like what it shows. There\'s a guy on YouTube who uses it to explain what he thinks is going on. I think that his views are generally (90%?) accurate, though his attitude is sometimes a little juvenile. See, for example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSNTdSSLauQ .\n\nI\'ve had a little training in the sciences, but I\'m not quite ready to buy into the electron orbital interpretation (which would get us into Heisenberg\'s uncertainty principle, etc., etc.) I think that there are numerous deterministic influences on which functions we are using at any moment and in what degree. Social context is obvious. Aptitude is a factor that rarely gets much attention. (Know anyone who has a strong preference for something that they\'re just not very good at, even if they have high self-awareness?)\n\nHere, though, for your entertainment, is a quantum physics tie-in. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389041709000655 .\n\nOn function flipping.... Linda Berens has some interesting ideas about how we might use the ""shadow functions"" -- that is, the four that are the direct opposites of our four main functions -- when we are under stress. She and other theorists give names to these functions that denote soclai roles in which they postulate that they are applied. For example, the Dominant (""Leading,"" ""Primary,"" ""Base"") with inverted attitude is variously called ""Opposing,"" ""Observant,"" ""Ignoring."" (Just to complicate matters, she places it at #5 in her function stack, while socionics places it at #7.) I find all of this not only ambiguous, but also overspecified -- thus, unhelpful.\n\nBack to allowing that we all use all eight.... The main point of interest for me is, what am I trying to accomplish at this moment? Is there someone with whom I am not communicating effectively? What is it that they are trying to accomplish at this moment? If I am using my Ne to explain the meaning of life, the universe and everything, maybe I can bring it down to earth by switching modes for the benefit of my friend whose preference is Se (even if I am not particularly good at it.)\n\nOr maybe we can meet half-way. This stuff is, for me, about the meta-conversation -- making conscious rather than unconscious choices about how we relate to one another.', 'This site makes a good argument that Type Dynamics do not exist:\nhttp://oddlydevelopedtypes.com/content/cognitive-functions-and-type-dynamics-failed-theory', ""@rsngfrce\n\nI have to admit, I was extremely skeptical of the article you posted, but the more I read, the more the author's argument actually grew on me. I still disagree with some of the key points made, however. For example, comparing modern day personality type theory to the case of the planetary orbit theories of old is a bit ludicrous. Human psychology will never be as cut and dry as Newtonian physics -- apples and oranges. Nevertheless, I try to keep an open mind about such things and appreciate the new system the author proposes.\n\nThanks for the share."", 'AHA! Hahaha, WOW, DaveSuperPowers is one of the most entertaining and informative people I\'ve watched on YouTube! Thank you so much for that link. Not only that, but he blew the doors open for me on your Cusp argument that I\'d been struggling with since high school. Especially with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7067nqCcVI\n\nAs a Ne-dom, I had a general idea of the answer I was going to accept; like my mind had already been made up, no matter what arguments were placed in front of me. I came to your conclusion that No, you cannot be both. And an hour ago, after reading your opening statements I wanted to believe you, but I was still dealing with all the arguments that I\'ve heard for the concept, that I\'d been unable to dispell. I\'m not sure what part of human nature this is, but if 4 out of 5 people tell you something has to be true, there\'s part of you that starts to believe it. Oddly enough, as an ENTP, I could argue it. Seeing both sides of the argument comes naturally, so I HAVE to rely on my Ne to show me the way, no matter what I truly think. Its a tough world, knowing your right, but not being able to explain why, or more accurately, not believing why.\n\nAnyway, the data behind the conclusion came from Ne vs Ni, specifically how House (MD) comes up with his answers. ""He never had the explosion of ideas, he needed people to say things in order to solve the problem."" How you think, where your inspiration comes from; that is the answer to who you really are. There is no cusp, the questions are only a guide. You are who you are, and based on how you gather and interpret information, you fit into one of 16 types. Knowing thyself is something that takes a lifetime to master, unless you use MBTI to guide your way.', '@rsngfrce: Yes, I know oddylydevelopend types.com and find the site very entertaining and informative, though I am familiar with the author\'s views on Type Dynamics.

359,420,Self-sufficient Communities,"['Hello people.\n\nWhat do you think about self-sufficient Communities (Energy, Food, etc..) ?\n\nHow would you build up one ?\nWhat would be ""THE"" technology you would like to see in it ?\nSolar / Wind ? How to deal with livestocks ?\n\nJust curious how other people would do it with the tools we have today.\nSee you.', ""Not sure if you've ever heard of earthships, but my ex fiancÃ© would never stop talking about wanting to live in one, it grew on me as well. Earthships are extremely versatile and economic, they are made out of natural and recycled materials and they aim to be completely self-sustaining hence off the grid (reason as to why the american government completely hates them). They use solar and wind energy for heating, cooling and electricity amongst other things, its a pretty cool concept.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/L9jdIm7grCY"", 'Nice, Steamtech also showed me:\nhttp://phys.org/news/2016-01-battery-molten-metals-low-cost-long-lasting.html\nThis could be helpful on a higher scale, for necessary industrial plants and maintenance factories.\nBut on a house level, this is very interesting.\nThank you', ""Personally\nA self sufficient community would need aquaponic gardens, either centrally located in a large facility or split up per household. Aquaponic gardens would need a bit of care to get going but could easily sustain multiple families, there is one in Colorado US, that's around 3,600sq/ft (335m^sq) that can output as much produce as a 20acre farm, not to mention just as much in fish as well, as thats part of the cycle. These farms can be built at any scale.\n\nSolar can be used in a few ways, not only electricity, but put the right lens in a ceiling and it could be used to cook food, or heat water depending on the aparatus. Wind energy could be used for electricity or to generate compressed air, or pump water from an aquifer. Not to mention sustainable electricity can also be pulled from ionizing particles in the atmosphere. The article that @TheFrenchCoq links would be instrumental for power storage.\n\nHeavily insulated homes, and geothermal cycling of air would help maintain temperatures inside the homes. The heavy insulation I'm thinking of would be like dirtbag homes, or using large compressed dirt bricks that have been fired. All of which can be locally sourced in most countries, build those houses deeper in the ground or in the side of a mountain the less resources you'd use on construction.\n\nThe geothermal cycling would be like pumping water through tubing into a 30ft (9m) hole and back up, removing heat or adding heat to an area. Down at 30ft (9m) the ground is temperature stabalized, pumping water down that far then up again stabilizes that water, have air running over those pipes and that will either add or remove heat depending on the season.\n\nLive stock, would be chickens they are easy to raise, produce lots of eggs and can be eaten as well.\nHoney bees and farms also need to be at each aquaponic farm. Honey bees other than pollinating each plant in said farm, they create honey which can be stored for very long periods of time. Not to mention that honey has been and can be used as a preservative, and an antiseptic for bandages. Honey when it decomposes creates hydrogen peroxide as some antiseptic molecules.\n\nFood wastes can be put in compost bins and broken down into compost and used in the hydroponic gardens. Human wastes can be dealt with much the same, as long as the people going into the community aren't squeamish. Solid wastes can be broken down and separated, the solid material once the bad bacteria is washed/baked away it can be used to create biodegradable cups or planters. Not to mention Urine can be recycled down the elementary components for use in other areas.\n\nWater can be stored, and reclaimed in a man made aquifer and smaller aquifers for each home. Filters can be made from charcoal and locally sourced sand and dirt. Charcoal can be made from waste materials, I.E. fibers from plants or waste plant parts. This can be made on site.\n\nBamboo will also need to be grown and used on site for things such as scaffolding, piping, flooring, laminate, charcoal, etc. Wheat would also be a useful resource.\n\nLocal sources of iron, and other minerals can be found to supplement for trade or other uses. A self-Sufficient community should have its own maker space essentially. Large machines like a lathe, mill, loom, thread wheel, saw, press, forge, and metal working tools need to be all supplied."", 'I just spent more time reading up on communes and the Amish than I think I ever have. Thanks for that.\n\nI have doubts about intentional communities that intend to sustain themselves by ""going backward"", i.e. forsaking modern technology, engaging in complete isolationism, and trying to do away with the idea of money or personal ownership. It seems like the only ones that survive longterm (I\'m mainly talking about the Amish and similar groups, here) started back in the day, holding onto a way of life that they were largely born into, and though different, was not too different economically and technologically from what was available in their day. Unless a community splits every time they hit 150 they\'re going to have to expand, and that usually means purchasing more land, setting up more infrastructure, and increasing production, which is going to cost money, force them to connect with the outside world, and likely adopt modern farming methods.\n\nI think to do it in this day and age you\'d have to start off with a lot of funds to set things up (I\'m talking millions), in an area safe from most natural and manmade disasters and with an endless supply of water (preferably a waterfall), and eco-friendly modern conveniences should be embraced. Hydroelectric power, supplemented by solar in the winter if necessary (having separate winter behaviours and accomodations may not be a bad idea if there\'s enough money). Set up the greenhouses and the plant agriculture before introducing poultry and small livestock (sheep, goats, and the like; cattle probably wouldn\'t be the best if you\'re trying to be eco friendly or keep costs down). Be selective with the populace regarding profession (mainly farmers, mechanics, engineers, medical and veterinary professionals, a few economists, and teachers) and attitude (no hermits, no loafers), keeping them at the population level of a [small] township.\n\nDemocracy (esp. by a council) seems to work decently well for small, nearly homogenous communities, so let\'s go with that.', '@ConsumerOfStories - I think ""Going backward"" Would be the worst possible thing we could do as a society. Technology is a paramount in the development of a sustainable colony or community.\n\nWe\'d need lots of these, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMV6IBzmjs some specialized for medical uses, and some designed more for engineering or sciences.\n\nAnd in order to go forward we need to innovate, mix old tech with new tech. For example mix sterling engine(old tech) with newer tech, micro-controller, thermal sensors, and atomized fuel injectors or even better magnetically confined plasma chamber as a heat source instead, to come up more efficient power generation.', ""I would build an underground tunnel system, with a geothermal plant for energy, and a farm+arboretum, also underground, for food / CO2 processing. I think THE technology I'd like to see is that knocky thing where you can control stuff by tapping different rhythms on the surface of anything. Or maybe a VI-controlled central computer."", ""I'm with allblackeverything - I belong to an EarthShip community in my area and have participated on several builds. They are awesome. Although they've been around for several decades, they still have some unresolved issues. They are self-sufficient, mortgage free, use recycled materials, treat waste water by recycling grey water up to four times and through the built-in year round greenhouse. They don't draw on the aquifers for water - instead collect rainwater. You can also build other structures such as greenhouses and barns using the same design and technology. Building one of these babies is extremely labour intensive. You haven't suffered until you've pounded 300 lbs of earth into a one tire using a sledge (x about 750 tires for a 1000 sq ft earthship). For a barn-greenhouse and aquaponics, I would prefer the design of Anna Edey as described in her book Solviva. The thing about that type of living, is that it almost requires a like-minded community approach, a type of makerspace, sharing of tools, pooling of skills, labor and technology. The concepts attracts two types of people: adventurous geeks and idealistic flakes (no offense intended to anyone who identifies with either camp)."", '...pooling of skills, labor and technology. The concepts attracts two types of people: adventurous geeks and idealistic flakes (no offense intended to anyone who identifies with either camp).', ""@SZNEL - What kind of unresolved issues do earthships have?

Self-sufficient communities are based on taking only what you need. You need to do a cost-benefit analysis including environmental costs before you bring in cattle or any large animal.

Are you familiar with the approach? It uses the observed features in a natural ecosystems and is based on care of the earth, of people and a return of surplus.

You may be able to keep the community small and avoid expansion if all the members agree to limit births and manage their population in accordance with the territory they have. I also agree with you that you need to attract the skills, expertise and education necessary to sustain the community and resolve technical problems. As for money, no getting around the need for it, but you could set up a local, non-capitalist economy with functional links to the outside economy. Getting the latest iPhone, Wii or Xbox would have to cease to be a priority. I think the issues would arise in the 2nd generation.

I like it!', ""Steamtech - Permaculture is a design of beauty. We have a group experimenting with aquaponics using the dirty fish water to fertilize the plants in their greenhouse and the plant soil also cleans the water (granted still grey water) but I am uncertain if it's ethical to basically trap fish, especially those that have the instinct to migrate. Seems kind of cruel. So far, all the group has grown is catfish and tilapia. The stock is quite expensive and you can't forget about it, it requires daily monitoring - technology could help with that. If you can reproduce your own little ones, you've got a very cheap source of protein. We've also tried inoculating birch logs with oyster mushroom mycellium. Mine didn't turn out but others have had better luck."", ""Steamtech - one of the most critical issues to be resolved is how to store the energy you collect via wind/solar or water turbine. The earthships use a bank of marine deep cycle batteries but they have limitations. I am wondering if a Ballard?™s hydrogen fuel cell such as the FCgen-H2PM would be better (suppose you could afford it)? The FCgen is suited for application ranging from 1kW to 30kW. If you're running a home, greenhouse and maybe a barn, a bank of marine batteries are eventually going to let you down especially if your energy source (sun or wind) peters out for a while (i.e., winter typically has less sun, at least in my area)."", ""SZNEL - Getting a setup with aquaponics and the Permaculture wouldn't be too difficult I would think. Especially if you simulate the migration aspect of the fish through a larger water tank, say moving between the aquaponics garden and the outside. Also wastes from the aquaponic's system like food wastes can be used to help out any of the permaculture especially when starting out.\n\nFuel cell wouldn't work well in my opinion, how are you going to get the hydrogen? There's several ways each one costs a lot of energy/money, for example electrolysis you get about half or less of the amount of energy you put into it back. There are other ways to get hydrogen, but energy is lost in conversion, so its not a super great solution on top of that water is kind of precious so it would need to be conserved.(I'm thinking on a larger scale)\n\nThere is a company that I told @TheFrenchCoq about, they are create Molten Salt batteries meant for grid storage. These devices would work rather well as when you charge a battery it gets hot or if you use a lot of the battery's power it also gets warm. Since the core of that battery is already molten not much changes, and the company is making it out of materials that are easy to find in most areas of the world. The only thing that's hard is finding the liquid metals for use in the anode and cathode.\n\nEven then there is a company in Germany that is working on a style of grid storage in the form of a super large compressed air tank. You have wind powered compressors basically filling up that tank, and when you need the power from the tank you open a valve into a high and low pressure turbine to generate electricity. Most of the device can be created with lathe mills and a forge, and some way to make pottery or concrete containers\n\nAlso as an alternative to cattle for a self sufficient colony, you could have rabbits. They could be fed via the gardens are easy to maintain and reproduce rather fast, they'd make a good steak, especially if they were a larger breed."", 'Steamtech - I had envisioned an aquaponic system similar to what you describe, less captive and more of a ""river system"". The molten salt battery sounds like an alternative. In the Ballard system, the hydrogen is obtained from water using a membrane that creates an osmosis-like reaction. That\'s what makes the Ballard technology so powerful. I don\'t understand it 100% - the explanation they provide of how their product works raises more questions than answers. My brother raised rabbits for awhile, they are not easy. They are prone to many diseases especially when raised in close quarters. My sister-in-law and I cried our eyes out when my brother harvested Ernie and Mike.

365,426,Where is the ENTP in your life?,"['Haven\'t been on this site very long. Already I notice several posts about ""Well I dated this, that and this. But never dated an ENTP. I\'ve talked to one and it was great blah blah blah."" . Obviously we\'re all on this site because of a mutual interest in the MBTI. So it begs the question why you INFJs haven\'t picked out an ENTP of your own. At first glance of the numbers, I\'d assume it was a population issue. ENTPs make up something like 3%, where the INFJs make up 1%. Both rare, but since many have seemingly met ENTPs I\'d like to read the reasons. Side note: Typing that out actually made me wonder if I\'ve known many INFJs and didn\'t realize it.', ""If I have ever met one personally, I didn't know it. I hear a lot of INFJs are attracted to ENTPs quite often. I'm really curious why. Mostly I hear what ENTPs think the INFJ is attracted to but what I get from other INFJs is you guys compliment our need or passion to feel. Which is curious, very curious."", 'I figure if you did, it was the person who had a lot of other people around them at all times. From what I gather, introverts might have a hard time being able to approach them.', ""Depends on the introvert really. Mostly as an INFJ, we are too busy taking in every aspect of our surroundings that we don't make a point to be in the actual surroundings. But we don't miss anything. Not sure being surrounded by a lot of people is something many INFJs would be attracted to. Unless the surrounded person is not actively seeking validation from these people of some sort."", ""Oh, you haven't heard? INTP is the new ENTP, apparently. http://bit.ly/NTPbestie"", ""@JustinD. Lol man for some reason I can't like your post on the main page, but that's great. What was the context of that comment? Can't seem to find it anywhere."", 'Nehai - Why haven\'t INFJ\'s picked out an ENTP? It\'s possible some have been in the grip of the ENTP ""gone bad"" and while now free, are feeling that once bitten, twice shy. What\'s an ENTP gone bad you may ask? Think Joker in the Dark Knight: controlling, manipulating, selfish and cruel. I imagine that it can be difficult to sort out after a burn like that, especially for an INFJ. But well worth the effort, I\'m told.', ""There seems to be a bug, I can't like your post @Justin, LOL."", 'I am INFP and I had some interactions with an ENTP... well... after some time when it looked that he finally decided to ""connect his heart and head"" to put some more effort into our relationship something happened and over one weekend in the same town as his ex girlfriend he returned to her... it is hard to comprehend when he was saying how controlling she is... the same evening she took his phone behind his back and blocked me everywhere... I needed three months to recover from this bullshit... but I heard from others that before mentioned ENTP looks 10 older and tortured right now...', ""I don't think if have ever dated an ENTP, well not that I know of, although I believe many of my female friends fall into this category. My last relationship of 8 years was an INFP and although we understood each other 100%, ultimately this was the downfall of our relationship. We were just too similar! I would be very interested in getting to know some ENTP's, which is one of the reasons I'm here."", ""I don't think I've ever dated an ENTP, well not that I know of, although I believe many of my female friends fall into this category.

I would be very interested in getting to know some ENTP's, which is one of the reasons I'm here."", 'The ENTP in my life was not super mature. He was 23 when I met him, and I think he was still looking for a ""perfect innocent flower soul mate"" i.e.- a woman who hasn\'t been ""tarnished."" Six months later, when I moved away from his state for a new job, he admitted deep into the night that he missed me, and wished I would move in with him, and be his girlfriend. lol.\n\n', 'The ENTP in my life is a male friend. We connected instantly on an emotional and intellectual level. I feel like I can explain my thoughts and feelings and that he understands exactly where I stand. I value our relationship largely because I feel free to be myself. I feel like he ""gets"" me and appreciates the ""raw"" feelings I express. We play music together in similar circles. When he says something sort of abstract, and other people are looking at him like he\'s out of his mind, I have to laugh, because I totally understand the reference. He\'s married to a women who gives him quite a bit of freedom, so he is a lucky man. I respect their relationship and I would never cross that line. I think he knows this, and so he has become a trusted friend. Even if he wasn\'t married, I don\'t know that I could keep up with his energy level all of the time.', 'I find it really interesting how on accurate this pairing seems to be. I have never had the pleasure of knowing an INFJ woman as far as I know, but everyone here makes it sound fantastic. In many of my past relationships I was partly at fault for being "" Too intense"" and I acknowledge that I can be a bit much for some people to deal with, but I would be really intrigued to explore a relationship with someone I am actually compatible with. As apparently I\'ve never had that privelige.', 'I find it really interesting how on accurate this pairing seems to be.

As apparently I\'ve never had that privelige.', ""You want my honest answer? When I learned that women INFJs are supposed to be attracted to ENTPs a lot, to me it was like a slap in the face. My father is an ENTP (to a probably INFJ mom which is hilarious in itself). He's the most insensitive man I've ever met making him an abusive prick to me (and my mom) who can either make my day awesome or the worst of my life. And that has been my relationship with ENTPs my whole life. They're usually too direct for me, I feel immediately attacked, judged and sometimes even preyed on. My ex-boyfriend was an ENTP too, I say boyfriend but really I was just the nice girl that would sleep with him when he got bored of his actual girlfriend. Manipulative, self-centered, indecisive, shallow and immature. He was the kind of guy to do anything to get the attention even if it meant hurting people's feelings or get himself and others into trouble. I'm not gonna lie though, there was a definite chemistry otherwise this shitshow wouldn't have lasted 5 years. Nice conversations when they can hold in place and concentrate for more than 30 seconds at a time... or be honest about it and not act like they don't have feelings, or straight up mess with you because they can. ENTPs without a tangible goal in life tends to get bitter and mean too. The other ENTP of my life is my brother, he's the only one I can deal with. Yet he will too put himself into bad situations to avoid getting bored. Direct but not too insensitive either. Smart and funny. ENTPs done right have the rational side we lack. INFJs generally go for smart people in any situation plus ENTPs can definitely be funny and I think that's probably the three main reasons why INFJs likes ENTPs so much. INFJs need someone that will rationalise the situation with them, ENTPs can be very faithful, passionate and caring when they choose to invest themselves, they also have interesting ideas and they can distract us from the world and our problems by being funny... until THEY become the problem and then it's unlivable. I truly believe though that ENTPs done right are good people but the ones I know are too self-centered (or uncomfortable let's be honest) to even consider the fact that I have feelings and that they can and will be hurt by insensitiveness. And they will for most part use their intelligence and charisma to use others to their own benefits and INFJs is the type that will react the worst to that kind of behavior. Long story short, ENTPs of my life are the people that brought me some of the best moments of my life but they are also the people that crippled me for the rest of my life so unless a miracle happens I'm done with them, there's too much risks to it for me.""]","['Romantics ', 'Personality', 'INFJ - Counselor']",INFJ - Counselor
366,428,ENTJ with other Rationals/Analysts,"['As an ENTJ gay man I found so hard to date (about going on a decade single... I mean, weeks long pseudo-relationships do not count, OK?) Although I\'m a cold analytical, I\'m emotionally accessible and needy for affection (which it doesn\'t seem to be an ENTJ trait but we all come in all colors I guess). I often get disappointed when someone I date is unable to go into deep conversations, intellectual topics or freely talk about their feelings. To others ENTJs: Are INTJs and other Rational/Analytical types, the intellectual challenge you thought it would be? Is it rewarding? A funny thing is (and I don\'t know if it happens the same with you) when I\'m attracted to someone I\'m in not in Attack-mode (As we all know we can be). I would only get into an argument if there\'s a contention about a topic we both know, ultimately the one with the facts straight wins!\n\nI think at this point I\'m over dating the ""opposite"" of me, starting to date other Rationals seems to be the solution to my solitude... Testimonial of other ENTJs would be greatly appreciated.', ""Like the photos you added at the bottom of your post. Is that an NT thing, to illustrate? I would never think of doing that. Not an ENTJ or even an NT but going to post here anyway, you can always delete it if you don't like it :). If there's anything I've noticed it's that intellectual challenge and willingness to go into deep conversations and freely talk about feelings has very little if anything to do with type. Perhaps at younger ages when we are slightly more insecure and happy to share everything with everybody, which isn't necessarily healthy, look how many young people suffer from depression and other forms of psychosocial disorders because of the effects of using social media indiscriminately and exposing every last bit of themselves to a world that ultimately doesn't care about them. But as we get older walls go up, patterns form, people get set in whatever bad habits they formed, and only a very few try to be self aware and even that is very hard. So I don't think it's an ENTJ or NT thing. It's about finding people that are on the same page as you. People that are willing to listen, willing to share, willing to change, and ultimately, willing to be vulnerable."", 'Wow... how can someone write an entire paragraph and at the same time saying nothing.

Second, you\'re not an ENTJ, how dare you say what I (or we) do or we don\'t do, don\'t be presumptuous, particularly when you\'re not adding anything of value to the conversation.\n\nI regard looking for deeper conservations or oversharing or being vulnerable. Guess what? WALLS block EVERYTHING, both the bad AND the good. I have always walls around me, armored steel no less, and what does that bring? ALIENATION. If you don\'t feel comfortable talking about you or your feelings with people that is YOUR problem, not mine. What maturity have brought to me is accept myself without seeking approval and just in the journey to find someone with the same mentality. You also mention change, that\'s a MISTAKE, people should NEVER change to please others because is all facade that soon or later will fall. Sure, we modify aspects of our behavior that are negative or destructive, but that\'s the extent of adjustment nothing else.\n\nNow, if you still feel the need to reply again to my topic do everyone a favor and abstain from useless personal opinions about ME and actually say something of value that anyone could use.

I hadn't thought of it before. When I saw it I made a mental note that that could be a cool way to make posts more interesting.\n\nIf you don't like it you can delete it was a joke. I guess it got lost in translation.\n\nI haven't really read all of your post because it's full of so much anger which I'm sure has nothing to do with me. My post wasn't based on you. I don't know you at all. I haven't even looked at your profile. I was sharing my observation based on my life and the lives of people I know and the things I've read or heard. Vulnerability is the key. Your reply to me for example is quite hurtful but I'm willing to accept it because I made myself vulnerable by responding to your post in the way that I did. I am actually shaking right now. And again if I wasn't prepared to be vulnerable, I wouldn't say that, I would pretend that your reply has had no effect on me at all, but it has.\n\n\nI hope you find whatever you're looking for."", ""Me?

I've grown up with an enormous appreciation for intelligence, insight, and creativity, and there's no type with which I'm familiar that encourages a more vast, pervasive, and penetrative intellect.\n\nCombine this with the J quality of INTJs, which compels them both to confer their intellectual energies into extensive, detailed plans and to execute on those plans with precision and dedication.\n\nPopular fiction has been quick to notice how this is a perfect recipe for world-changing visionary megalomaniacs (though it seems megalomania is more characteristic of the vastly more successful ENTJs). However, though some INTJs have made it to the world stage (namely Elon Musk, Nikola Tesla, Mark Zuckerberg), none have managed to inspire the beautiful changes we expect of you. Nikola Tesla blamed this on the ''blind, faint-hearted, doubting world'' that is ''not yet sufficiently advanced to be willingly led by the discoverer's keen searching sense.'' No doubt, there is truth to this, but it's far from a productive observation.\n\nSo, in the name of productive, positive change, here is your stage:\nWhat specifically makes it difficult for you, as an INTJ, to effect your long-term vision? Moreover, as visionaries yourselves, I imagine you've pondered this very question, and have designed in your own minds worlds that offer the INTJ sufficient opportunities to reach their potential (forgive my singular-they.

The only time I step in and take over is when I see a bunch of incompetence (usually from management) that threatens to make life more difficult for everyone. To answer your question more specifically, the only way to make the huge changes in our society that we envision is with strong leadership.

Camp 2: they know one or fewer people of their desired sex or sexes who belong to this ideal type, but several of an undesired sex. Camp 3: they know no one of the ideal type whatsoever.

The vast majority of Camp 2 believes that this ideal type is better as a friend than as a mate, and tends to cling to the first type on my list for which they know an attractive member of the desired sex as their ideal.

If I decided to throw a rock in the air, then the coming consequences will be exactly the same as every consequence that followed every movement I have ever made; the consequence will be mine and not that of any external force.\n\nRemember, I am now totally physical. In this context I have no spiritual. The Soul,Spirit,God,Heaven and Hell are non existent and are only manifestations created by physical beings to gain further control of other physical beings.\n\nHow can a spiritual realm exist if all that exists is physical. Our world is governed by the movements of ""Right"" and ""Wrong"", physical Universals that should govern our existence.\n\nIf we consider that Masters,Saints,Yogi and other individuals gained spiritual achievements we may use the physical makeup to understand their statements: Meditation is a tool to manipulate the brain and the mind ( There is no difference), living encumbered would have great affects on the brain in response to Hormonal Excretions.\n\nWe then should consider that no amount of Religious work or Spiritual misdirections would create a better living environment on a global scale. Considering that a physical approach would be ultimately better to deal with a physical existence. An approach that deals with Principles and Morals on a global scale, a Philosophical approach with tangible results where control is internal based and easily measured through external approaches.\n\nThe new heads of Religious Cults need now be removed from power and replaced with Philosophies and Philosophers ready to teach what would create global peace and Just. A society run on rules and regulations created by imaginary friends solely for the purpose of cattle herding is not a way of the future. A moral and principled global society is now what is needed, a society run on Universals where our Popes or whatever are the planet\'s Great Thinkers and Philosophers,Psychologist. We need now a Physical approach to a Physical problem.\n\nThank You', 'If you are serious about philosophy, then you should start with metaphysics. Your entire post is begging the question of materialism.\n\nYou make the claim that you are \'totally physical\'. I assume this means you ascribe to materialism. You presuppose that worldview then. This is common, given that most of society and academia is materialistic. A problem arises when you don\'t question that worldview and why it exists. There are viable alternatives, and some do not require abandoning the wealth of knowledge science has provided us\n\nThe biggest problem with materialism is known as the \'hard problem of consciousness\'. To put it precisely: ""Where do mental properties come from when physical things don\'t have them?"" I encourage you to do some research into different perspectives, from people of different worldviews. It\'s an excellent debate.\n\nThe worldview I\'ve adopted is known as idealism. Instead of matter being \'real\', Mind is what is real. Everything is a mental object, and what is physical is just a configuration of \'Mind\'. Science is just as valid, it just doesn\'t tell us what reality is made of.\n\nReligion and spirituality is really not as simple as you make it out to be and is influenced by your materialistic worldview. Examine the problems with materialism and possible alternatives. Be a critical thinker. If you feel materialism stands up to the challenge, debate it. It\'s a great way to grow.', 'What is interesting to me is that both of your postings provide for a world that is confined and does not have anything that exists outside of itself: either it is physical and nothing else; or it is of the mind and nothing else.

Knavs studied design and architecture at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia. She then worked as a model for fashion houses in Milan and Paris before relocating to New York City in 1996.\n\nAfter moving to New York City , Knavs supposedly met Donald Trump at a Fashion Week party in New York City in September 1998. Their relationship gained attention after a 1999 interview on The Howard Stern Show, and additional publicity after the 2004 launch of Trump\'s successful business-oriented reality television show, The Apprentice. Donald Trump described their long courtship in 2005: ""We literally have never had an argument, forget about the word \'fight\' . We just are very compatible. We get along.""\nAfter becoming engaged in 2004, Donald Trump and Melania Knavs were married on January 22, 2005, at The Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a reception in the 17,000-sq.-ft ballroom at Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nTrump has always stated he met his wife Melanija at a fashion week party in 1998. But Anna Novak a matchmaker who operated an office in Slovenia for several ""Mail Order Bride"" companies, including a company called A Foreign Affair, says she received a call sometime around 1995 from the head office to help arrange a call between a female member Melanija, and A VIP client she only knew as Donald. Shortly after the call, Melanija asked to be removed as a member and to have her profile completely removed from the websites.\n\nIf this was truly ""The Donald"" and the ""Melanija"" then why the secrecy? Trump was married at the time, even when they met each at the Fashion Week party. It is not a secret that Trump has had a long history of infidelity, When married to his first wife, Czech model Ivana ZelnÃ­ KovÃ¡, he had an affair with actress Marla Maples, In 1992 Ivana\'s and Donald\'s divorce was finalized, shortly thereafter Donald sued Ivana for $25 million, alleging she was not honoring a gag clause in their divorce agreement by disclosing facts about him. Maples and Donald were married the following year after his first divorce on December 20, 1993. The couple\'s divorce finalized in June 1999, nearly one year after the Fashion Week party where supposedly Donald met Melanija for the first time.\n\nA spoke\'s person for A Foreign Affair\' in Phoenix AZ, says.

375,439,Offline matchmaking making a serious rebound,"['\n\n\nAfter nearly 20 years of growth in the online dating/matchmaking industry, offline is making a big comeback. Why online matchmaking is prone to massive fraud, intentional and unintentional. Men complain that women\'s profile pictures have no resemblance to the way they really look. Both men and women constantly use old photos from 10 to 20 years in the past. Also with people now taking literally thousands of photos of themselves, they have a chance to find one that makes them look really good. If you have 1,000 photos of yourself and pick the one the make you look your best, most likely it not going to be a real representation of yourself. James of Scottsdale, Arizona, was so frustrated about the way women looked that he started asking women to meet him outside the restaurant and then he would sit in his car with binoculars to see if they even came close to looking like their profile picture. If they did not, he would just stand them up.\nMen also make themselves sound better physical and economically. The term ""$30,000 dollar millionaire"" was coined to describe men who drive very high-end cars but are flat broke. Women start dating these men, thinking they are extremely wealthy, then later find out they live at home with their mothers. So there is no wonder many men and women feel like the Internet is just too laced with fraud.\n\nJenny from Wisconsin says she is frustrated that men online are fixated on women\'s appearances and have no interest in getting to know the person inside. Dating expert Steven says men\'s brains are hardwired to look for a mate that will have a high probability of producing and caring for offspring, just as women are hardwired to search for men who can be good providers for the family. Evolutionary biologists have discovered a lot of the physical traits we consider attractive have a sound basis in genetics.\n\nMany websites have now started doing ID verifications, guaranteeing that the person posting the profile is who they say they are, but this only addresses their identity, not their social standing or appearance. Over the years many companies have been trying to use live video chat to help its clients get a real Idea of the persons appearance. But so far, no company has had a great success with this. One of the main reasons is that women tend to surf dating sites at night, after they have come home from work or school. At that point, they have removed their makeup and dress more casually; thus, they do not feel comfortable with live video.\n\nSo with so many users dissatisfied with online experience, many users are just giving up online dating, citing too many bad experiences. According to industry experts, as many as 50% of women do not show up for dates made online. So what is the best way to find love? For age groups in the early 20s, social events (work, school, bars, parties, and activities) are still one of the main methods of meeting someone that leads to a serious relationship. These seem to work much less well as men and women get older. When you are in your 30s or 40s, your options decrease, as the people you meet in social environments are more likely to be already in a relationship, disqualified due to personal reasons, have children, pay alimony, medical issues and so on. This group from the mid-30s and up has the hardest time finding love online or in their everyday social life. So what seemed to be a dying industry is now having a rebirth. Matchmakers and speed dating companies are booming. The singles events company Pre Dating now offers over 1,000-speed dating events yearly in the US, some upper-end matchmaking services like Executive Global Match charge from $15,000 to $25,000. It\'s Just Lunch and Great Expectations start off around $5,000 for arranging dates.\n\nOne of the biggest jumps in offline matchmaking is the international matchmaker or foreign bride industry. A Foreign Affair has combined offline with online matchmaking. A unique business, it requires all women to come into a local office in one of thirty different countries. This guarantees the appearance of the women and their identity. The men must fill out a background form. The men can correspond with the women online, but when they are ready to meet, they have the option going on one of the company\'s group tours and attend several events they call ""Socials or Dating on Steroids."" These events consist of 20 to 50 men and 200 to 500 women. The men travel in groups to Russia, Ukraine, Asia, and Latin America. All women are prescreened by their local offices. Kenneth Agee, co-founder, says, ""This is the ideal situation. We screen the women for looks and sincerity. The women love the events because they know men who travel this far are very serious about finding wives. It is a perfect combination. Just think about the last time you were in a room with hundreds of beautiful single women all looking for love.""\n\nNeil Clark Warren, CEO, co-founder and spokesperson for eHarmony, is the most recognized face in the online matchmaking industry. As EHarmony moved back to offline matchmaking, Warren went on Fox News to say, ""Let us do all the work. You will never get a rejection letter again. We talk to you before, and we talk to them after, and we get you at least one match per month."" The new offline matchmaking service is $5,000 per year with a minimum of 12 matches a year. eHarmony has gone through several shakeups over the years but has returned to its roots as a matchmaker service instead of being a dating site.', ""With quartz watches, however, the http://www.plawatches.org/ only vibrates at a very minimal amount.

376,440,Do Mail Order Brides Really Exist?,"['\nDo mail order bride really exist?\n\nThe answer is Yes, and No, it really depends on your definition of mail order brides.\n\nThe historical roots of the mail-order bride industry that emerged in the 1800s in the American frontier: European American men found financial success in the migration West, but the one thing that was missing was the company of a wife. Very few women lived there at this time, so it was hard for these men to settle down and start a family. They attempted to attract women living back East; the men wrote letters to churches and published personal advertisements in magazines and newspapers. In return, the women would write to the men and send them photographs of themselves. Courtship was conducted by letter, until a woman agreed to marry a man she had never met.[9] Many women wanted to escape their present way of living, gain financial security and see what life on the frontier could offer them. Most of these women were single, but some were widows, divorcees or runaways.\n\nDuring most of the 20 century, the mail order bride continued with the main method of women putting themselves in catalogs. Then men would view the women\'s profile, then for a fee order the women address. These became the main order bride companies business method in the 20 the century, with the fall of the Soviet union and cheap airfares, these companies spread from Asian to Eastern Europe, mainly now the Ukraine\n\nToday most women do not leave their countries to escape poverty but to seek a man they believe will be a good husband and provider, that is family orientated and that looks at women with more respect than in many countries around the world.\n\nWith the advent of the intent, the mail order bride industry boomed into a billion dollar industry, Now with a few pictures and website, anyone could be in the mail order bride business. With hundreds of ma and pop shops opening over the last two decade, Most who were clients of one of the three original mail order bride companies, A Foreign Affair (AFA), Anastasia and EC, The owner of ForeignLadies.com met his wife while working on a tour from loveme.com, A Foreign affair still today in the largest in the industry, each week they offer tours to one of a dozen countries China to Peru and everywhere in between. The industry grew so fast in 1998, Senator Cantwell of Washington state introduces legislation to regulate the mail order bride industry. and a new law Called: ""International Marriage Brokers Act"" or IMBRA was born. With stiff regulations, many companies like Anastasia moved from Bride business to Fantasy Chat.\n\n\nAlthough the industry strongly objects to the term mail order brides, saying there is no difference if man in New York courting a woman from California through match.com, then courting a woman from Russia. Critics like the Terra Justice Center has a different out look, saying these men take advantage of women oversea. But studies have contradicted these statement and show abuse is actually lower in these marriages. See ""International Marriages - A Report to Congress""\n\nSo why do thousands of women join these site: Elena Kosalova of the Ukraine says, ""Men here are not serious about family, they expect women to stay home while they go out each night with their friends and drink. I want a man who s serious, mature and who wants to be with his wife and family. I have met Americans in the past and they seem more reliable and mature."" Elena rejects the idea she is a ""Mail Order Bride""\n\nWhy do men seek a mail order bride: James Goodwin, 43 of South Carolina says, "" I meet women here all the time, but I just can not find the values I am looking for.. I have dated here for more than 20 years, After three days in Kiev, I was shock at how many beautiful women I met that I would consider marrying, now I am just trying to reduce my options and pick the right one. It truly is the fastest way to find a beautiful sincere women.\n\nSo what is the cost, the cost can range greatly from site to site and from type of service, AFA or loveme.com offers everything from letter writing, tours and executive services for the rich and famous. As little as $12 to as much as $25,000. The owner John Adams say\'s the best way is just go over and meet then women, avoid letters and never waste money on expensive chat. You can meet up to 1000 beautiful women in just 10 days, it will be the greatest vacation of your life. Joe Nail of ForeignLadies.com, has stayed with the traditional Letter Writing, Each letter is $7.50 and but say they do plan on offer some limited chat option.\n\nMany sites like,foreignwomen.com, PhilippineSinges.com, and UkraineSsingles.com, that offer simple unlimited membership for $29 per month. These type of site also target pacific regions, like Asia, Latin America or Eastern Europe.\n\nThere is also a site for mail order grooms; SingleMenOnline.com, that caters to men publishing their photos in hopes to meet an American Bride.\n\nJames Dunn, who is a ghost writer for review sites says ""You get what you pay for. Membership sites to do not screen the members at all. so you never know who you really are writing, The big boys require the women to apply in person in one of their local offices. The companies that offer group tours will introduce you to hundreds of beautiful women, for the cost of $1000 to $3000 depending on location, about the same you would pay for any vacation. Several companies also do individual tours these can range from $750 to $1500, But only arrange one to one introductions, Always make sure they are biased in the USA or EU, Most of the complaints come from small agencies that are desperate and need to make as much as they can from you. Just a note, if the company is based in an a foreign country you will have no recourse if they do not follow through.\n\n\nSo do mail order brides exist, If you belive a if a woman is a mail order bride if she lives in another county then Yes, But if you believe it just another dating option like any on-line dating site, matchmaker or dating service, than No. . It really seems like a doubled standard in the world, If a women meets a man in Italy or France, then oh that is so romantic, but if a man meets a women in Philippines, than ....', ""It really doesn't matter what you want, chances are you can probably find it. The top types of http://www.watchesreplica2m.com/ are pocket watches, analog, digital, and quartz. http://www.watchesshopsuk.co.uk/ can actually be considered a separate genre as well.

377,441,How can you tell an ISFP 'likes' you?,"[""Okay, so my best friend is an ISFP, and I'm truly in love with her. This isn't a fleeting feeling; I've been feeling this way for ~2years. I really want to tell her how I feel, but I don't want to compromise our relationship, because she's honestly the best person I've ever met, and I connect with her so well. However, I feel that if I don't tell her I'm maintaining this facade, and I don't think that's fair to her.\n\nSo, I would like to hear back from some ISFP's about how they subtly show that they're attracted to people, because I know she would never straight-up tell me if she felt that way (maybe that's just an ISFP thing?), because before she's said something along the lines of 'I'd never be upfront about wanting to be with someone.'\n\nI want to know the best way of approaching this situation, because I really don't want to loose her.\n\nThis has really been tearing me up, so I look forward to your responses."", 'I have a best friend that is an ISFP and he likes it when I am straight with him. Just be honest about how you feel for her and say your scared and see what she wants to do.', ""Sorry to barge in on an ISFP topic but I love this kind of stuff.\n\nMy intuitive guess: ISFP and INFP have the same functions except ISFP use Se where INFP use Ne. Ne is about ideas, possibilities, living in your head. Se is about action, reality, living in the moment.\n\nSo I think if an ISFP likes you, they'll tell you. If they like you and they haven't told you, there is a reason. Maybe they're waiting to get to know you better, maybe they don't want to start something right now. With Fi Dom, there's always a reason."", ""I got caught up in saying what I thought that I didn't actually read your post in full first. Sorry. I didn't realise you'd been feeling this way for two years. If she really is an ISFP and she hasn't give any hints of wanting to be with you, in two years, then I don't think she wants a relationship. An INFP could hold it in for two years but I don't think an ISFP could.\n\nBut putting mbti aside, best friends fall in love with best friends all the time. And sometimes a person might not know how they feel about a friend until the friend says I love you. So, just do it."", ""I'm not sure about all ISFPs but personally I find showing my love interest towards a particular person really hard as I panick easily about romantic stuff. Anyway, if I happen to receive unwanted attention from someone I'm not romantically interested in I'll be careful to draw a line and kindly let them know I'd rather stay friends.\n\nNow, I have no idea how this friend of yours tends to act but if you don't feel comfortable in confessing your feelings all at once I believe that getting her used to the idea little by little through small gestures could be a good way to start, too. Then by her reaction you might notice how she feels.\n\nLastly, I agree with Cyanara about the best friends thing. Straightforwardness is good, she might not notice until you say it and if you're such good friends whatever thing might happen I don't think it will ruin your relationship so just go for it :D\n\n(I'm

378,442,What does Ni look like to INFJ and INTJ?,"['I\'ve heard it before. The advice to figuring out which of the 16 Myers Briggs type you are: read about all the cognitive functions to figure out if you use them. Thankfully, I was professionally typed a number of years ago, because if I had read about Ni to decide if I use it, it would have been an ""ehmmm"" situation. It\'s such a subconscious thing and it\'s hard (for me) to identify in others. So how do you define Ni? What does it look like to you?', 'Isn\'t Ni in opposition to Se? If Se is the observations of physical reality, Ni would be focused inwardly on an abstract observation. Brought together, Ni would be searching for meaning behind a particular thing they have observed in the world (Se). Overall, Ni seems to be asking, ""What does this really mean?""\n\nIn INFJs and INTJs, you will recognize what drives them is to see behind superficiality. This is most important to them, more important than obvious observations.Their middle two functions still support the Ni.\n', 'I read a blog by an introverted mother about her extroverted daughter. She points out that while she enjoys and exclaims gratification inside her mind (things like ""wow, that cake was delicious""), her daughter would say them out loud. I\'ve since used this to define my Ni. If someone were to ask me why I like Star Trek, I wouldn\'t be able to answer them right away. I\'d go through the week with the question in the back of my mind, at the same time, performing my daily functions. On one day, I\'d read an astronomy book and think, ""yeah, I like space, that\'s one reason why I like Star Trek."" then on another day, I\'d have a discussion on social equality with a friend and again, I would add that to the list of why I like Star Trek. I\'m doing this for a long period of time without realizing that I\'m still thinking about that silly Star Trek question. At the end of the week, I\'d tell my friend my reasons and she would have forgotten it already because my reply was so delayed.\n\n\nI think our inability to respond fast enough to anything that gets thrown at us (feedbacks, questions, events, etc) has to do with our need to ponder about the subject for a long period of time without talking about what is happening inside our mind. It\'s like how some extroverts are so talkative with other people. We on the other hand talk to ourselves, having conversations with ourselves at any given time (within a dream, while we\'re in the restroom, even while we\'re talking to someone else). But this is my experience with Ni, I don\'t know how it\'s like for other INJs. Also, this is a very broad explanation and may not describe a specific Ni case.', 'I think that was a VERY specific example nino96! I do this as well...need time to process & examine how I feel about something.', ""INFJs look at a coffee stain on the wall, insist it's a malignant spirit avatar and blames you for willful blindness to the truth because you are socially conditioned to believe in comforting fairy tales.\n\nINTJs look at a pee stain on the toilet, blame men for endangering public hygiene because when they refuse to pee sitting down they're socially conditioned to grasp onto their oppressive symbols of masculinity."", 'Why thank you for the profound insight KNich.', 'Oh uhm. I guess I didn\'t mean to say ""broad explanation"". I meant to say that I explained it for the specific introverted intuition case of where we tend to ponder about anything, even a trivial matter, for an extended amount of time. We\'d thoroughly think about any topic or any person for a long while before we can come to a general conclusion. And when we do, it may come off as incredibly insightful and prophetic to other people. Only they don\'t know that we\'ve just been silently analyzing these things out loud inside our mind for so long. In terms of analyzing people, I think it just may be a more of an instantaneous intuition for INFJs than for INTJs because you guys are so sensitive to others\' feelings. But I don\'t really know this part, so you tell me hahaha.', ""As someone obsessed with INTJs and INFJs, I'll be the first to say they aren't as mysterious as they seem. It's not an instant magical insight. It's not knowledge whispered in their ear from God. It's just that there's a lot of data swimming around - random things they've noticed - and it sits there, each swimming around and linking up with one another until it all ties together into a single tapestry. And the idea that comes from it will make sense, and the more they consider the data, whether with Te or Fe, the more connections they'll discover that reinforce the idea.\n\nI think the reason these ideas appear so insightful is that they're elegant. Elegance is the primary concern of intuitive dominants. Ideas cannot merely be accurate. They must be beautiful and deep. In the words of Ramanujan, an equation means nothing unless it expresses a thought of God. So when an intuitive dominant deigns others worthy of hearing their ideas, the ideas they utter will have such cleverness and such depth that the truth of it almost seems irrelevant"", ""I agree, people think that we're mysterious, but the truth is that we follow 3,4 or more trains of thought at the same time, and might be distracted by our own thoughts if we become bored. There are occasions in which I get a glance of a random object and it triggers a number of thoughts which lead to existential or scientific questions. Also, the cognitive functions (especially the executive ones) are affected by many factors, mainly your age and in my opinion the number of languages you speak. They are not directly linked to your personality."", 'For me, I notice Ni in another person when I realize that they just get what I am saying even when lacking the bridge I often fail to build to connect my points. The communication feels a bit effortless. However, I have seen ESTJs and ISTJs that almost mask as Ni. However, if I get far enough in conversation, the look of confusion on their face gives away their Si. Haha', 'Ah yes, the look of ""You\'re making my head hurt"" or ""If I could form a sentence right now, I would fly away so instead, I\'ll squint and change topics""', ""To me Ni is overanalyzing everything and everyone everywhere all the time even though I know it'll never be enough to the point where I get sick of myself and try to drown my own thoughts with YouTube and someone else's thoughts. More concretely it's overanalyzing that fucking MBTI test for weeks on end, analyzing everyone I've ever known through it, talk my patient friends' ears off about it, find this website at 1AM while I should be sleeping and answer this post even though it's 6AM now."",

380,444,INTP Mind and the difficulty of communication,"['The reason that INTPs have such difficulty making themselves understood, and project social personae of themselves which are misleading or superficial to their authentic selves, is because of complexity. The problem with INTP complexity is that the inner complexity is something that is consciously constructed. That is to say: given infinite time, patience and curiosity on the part of an idealised listener, I will be able to logically explain every little thought and belief I have ever held. When it comes to an analysis of his own thoughts and beliefs, the INTP possesses great internal clarity (to avoid confusion, it should be noted that this clarity does not apply towards objects outside the ""self,"" it means rather that the INTP more than any other type is able to describe the inner workings of his own mind in more or less accurate terms.)\n\nWhy is it then, that the INTP, who thinks so logically, and understands himself so well, feels constantly misunderstood by others?\n\nAn INTP\'s logical framework has several distinctive features which makes it more or less inaccessible to other people.\n\nThe first is the principle of universal inclusivity. The nature of INTP\'s conceptual framework is that it must be all-encompassing. Whereas an INTJ is satisfied with a theory which is generally accurate and useful, and is willing to ignore the inconvenient exceptions, an INTP must account for every single phenomenon experienced or conceivable, real or imaginary, probable or improbable, within his intellectual framework.\n\nThe second, and which is the logical derivative of the first principle, is the principle of non-locality. Everything has a logical framework locally, but also globally and universally. In an INTP\'s mind, a thing must not only fit into a logical network of facts and interpretations, but that entire logical network of internally consistent information must also then be externally consistent with other networks, previously compiled from analysing other subjects. This leads to an ornate system of inter-locking conclusions, facts and interpretations, which must be constantly re-juggled every time a new thought applies for admission.\n\nOver time, as the INTP grows older and accumulates more knowledge, this entire edifice snowballs into a huge, complex, unwieldy and often frail conceptual framework, which is nonetheless the most simple and elegant explanation the INTP had been able to construct, under the imperative of these global principles, in which no two nuggets of information, no matter how small or insignificant, can be allowed to contradict each other on a multitude of ontological levels.\n\nConsequently, that conceptual framework the INTP produces in the end is anything but simple or elegant, and when explaining ideas in a social context, we have a reputation for rambling or obfuscation. An INTP cannot give a simple answer to a simple question, because to the INTP, no question is ever isolated within a limited set of data from which you are able to quickly derive a logical answer. That question must be considered in relation to ALL data that the INTP has ever processed, and it is only by going through this entire intellectual autobiography, in excrutiatingly small detail, that the INTP is able to justify the apparently bizarre and counter-intuitive nature of his opinions.\n\nEspecially people judging INTP opinions through the lens of Te logic will perceive the INTP\'s opinions as highly illogical, because Te deals in localised logic, an argument with a limited number of premises which can be crammed into a 30 second explanation. An INTP\'s logic cannot accept this framework because to him, there are deep flaws in this argument once you apply the principles of non-local logic and universal inclusivity.\n\nBecause the INTP is unable to articulate his opinions in any manner which would avoid misunderstanding, and give others the impression of his very unusual conclusions as arising from irrationality, ignorance or prejudice, the INTP in a social setting will be inclined to remain a passive spectator to the debates of others, often finding himself unable to agree with any of the parties on anything internally. An additional social difficulty arises in the fact that he will not agree with people for the sake of being agreeable.\n\nIn the end the irony arises, that although no one enjoys a good discussion as much as the INTP, he is discouraged by negative experience from pursuing discussions with others. Usually he pursues them only with select people and even then, only on limited facets of his thinking, because the only person who is capable of really understanding the whole structure of his thoughts and beliefs is himself.\n\nThis also explains why an INTP cares so little of what others think of him: the intense contrast between the clarity of his self-knowledge, and the impossibility of being understood by others, inclines him to lean only towards his opinion when it comes to self-appreciation. It is not a contempt for others that leads him to ignore what others think of him; on the contrary. The INTP desperately wants to be understood, to find someone whose opinions deserve our consideration and caring. Experience teaches us to participate in the social world in a manner contrary to our own wishes.', 'While this is a beautifully detailed and almost entirely accurate description of Ti, specifically that of INTPs, it only scratches the surface of why Ti is difficult to articulate. If I might summarize, your theory is that Ti is so delicately constructed that to explain any part requires explaining the whole, and since explaining the whole is impossible, an INTP is likely to present a subset that doesn\'t fully explain his conclusions and therefore appears irrational. But irrationality is not necessarily the most common impression of INTPs, and the inability to give a straight answer to ""simple questions"" follows from a more sophisticated mechanism.\n\n1) Straight Answers\nSocial questions are not mathematically precise. The constraints aren\'t clear and it\'s difficult to know when you\'ve satisfied the query. So when presented with a social question, the INTP will spend a lot of time trying to better define the problem (often perceived as dodging the question) and will try to answer with excessively broad generalizations. To others this is frustrating and is often misinterpreted as aloofness. Furthermore, if an INTP is contradicted, he is likely to dig his heels in. This becomes a problem when someone asserts a generalization, which often prompts the INTP to purposefully find edge cases for which the generalization is untrue. This is where eccentricity and irrationality often bloom in the reputation of an INTP\n2) Complexity\nI maintain that INTPs are not internally complex. INTPs are fundamentally simple people with simple beliefs governed by a small collection of hard rules. This simplicity makes them extremely predictable and reliable once someone has taken the time to understand them. However, since the INTP chooses these rules consciously and conscientiously, the internal eccentricity of an INTP is directly related to his creativity. It\'s not that there are many rules. It\'s merely that the few rules may themselves be strange.\n3) Te\nTe users may not immediately appreciate Ti thinking, as it seems excessively constrained and protracted beyond all usefulness. But this impression is an immature one, and a Te user with adequate exposure to Ti will soon reform their opinion. Ti Te chemistry can be quite electric, because while Ti may be more exhaustive in its model, Te is far faster when deconstructing and systematizing complex data. The interplay between the two functions is mutually beneficial when each function is properly understood\n4) Intuition\nINTJs were mentioned, specifically with respect to the idea that INTJs don\'t care about pesky edge cases. This is not accurate. I believe the misinterpretation stems from the fact that INTJs, as Intuitive dominants, are more concerned with the nature of ideas than their consistency. In other words, an elegant argument is more valuable than an inelegant one even if the latter is somewhat more exhaustive than the former. However, as NTs, the four types agree that all good ideas should be both elegant and accurate, as the two seem often to go hand in hand. While it is useful to understand the difference between different attitudes of the same function (Te vs Ti), I find many distinctions are either erroneous or more properly attributed to function order. The big differences in thinking style between INTJs and INTPs apply equally between ENTPs and INTPs. Both of the former types care more idea oriented than logic oriented, and both pride themselves on their ability to solve problems by bringing together ideas from a wide array of disparate fields\n\nSpeaking of which, note that other NTs may share a lot of the same problems and sentiments as you\'ve described. I too think of myself as someone with clear and intimate knowledge of the interworkings of my mind, and I imagine that clarity may rival that of some INTPs. Just food for thought ;)', 'An excellent exchange, with parallels toward intuitive feelers.\n\nThis perception is the language by which our words form: indirect, but copious, in intricacy.\n\nIn accordance with the INTP, the ENTP may articulate and add; the INTJ may synthesize and debate; the ENTJ may steal for a marketing campaign; however, the INTP is the forefather of the original idea. His thoughts connect as a network of ropes, and by this crosshatched foundation, many individuals are behooved and ""caught"" by the internal consistency.\n\nTo each his own strength!', '""The INTP is the forefather of the original idea""\n\nIs this a universal statement, or just with respect to this conversation?

381,445,Can religion and science co-exist?,"[""First, I apologise if there is another topic similar to this one. Also, this is not intended to offend anyone I just want to form a structured conversation.\n\nSo, I was raised in an Orthodox household and my parents are quite religious. I believe that every person is entitled to an opinion so it doesn't bother me that they don't believe in the big bang or evolution. I am well aware that religion and science oppose each other, but I'd like to read different people's opinions. I was wondering if there are religious people who believe in scientifical theories or any scientists that are religious."", ""I've reached the point where I consider this question is so elementary that I normally don't even consider it worth discussing.\n\nReligion and science don't contradict each other.\n\nFundamentalism and science are what oppose each other. The only 'religious' people that have a problem with science are conservative ones that are stuck with a literal interpretation of the entirety of their religious text. It's simple-minded and foolish. The same goes for 'atheists' who make the same claim (that religion and science contradict each other). They're fundamentalists too. The reality is that religion makes moral claims. Its realm is that of meaning and philosophy. Science only enters into it via philosophy."", 'What about creationism?', ""Creationism is a literal interpretation of religious texts and thetefore, under his system, would be classified as fundamentalism.\n\nApparently many scientists are deists. They believe God showed up, made the laws and the initial conditions, and left forever. But I'm highly scientific and also religious, and not a deist. I'm not sure what to classify myself, but I believe God is a provable and measurable phenomenon. God is defined as a non-material entity whose influence is proportional to the total faith in Him for a given community. This entity exists everywhere, is greater than any one person, yet every person contains a part of it. There is a well understood phenomenon that obeys these properties, and a number of other properties attributed to God: religion. And, to me, if religion obeys all the stipulations of what God should be, then it is God. So since religion is real, God is real.\n\nI also think it's interesting to note that for most religions and for most of history, science and religion were the same thing. Understanding the laws of nature was akin to becoming closer to God and God's design. It was actually rather recently that the Church began to openly disagree with science, and that was because discoveries of the time interfered with the symbology of the Church. Jerusalem not being the center of the world, white light being the least pure, etc. But the prior thousands of years where they were the same thing proves religion and science can coexist, and perhaps that they should"", ""There's a problem with cultural religious ideals hanving to do with being part of a community. Group think, while it links people together, can be very dangerous. It's means your identity and belonging has strong ties to what you think. Deviance mean that the connections are broken. For some people, questioning your religion mean that you have to question your community, your family, your loved ones, and everything that has been foundation to your life and who you are.\n\nI'm an atheist. I grew up with a christian background. There are scientific religious folk and religious scientists.\n\nI see science in it's ideal form as being unbiased. It just wants to search for the most logical answers. But sometimes those answers are scary for more traditional religious beliefs.\n\nWish it didn't have to be so black or white for some people...\n\n"", 'Science is just exploration with a purpose and a pen. Religion has many definitions. I fail to see how they are inherently incompatible. For some, science IS a religion. For me, there is nothing unscientific about caring for widows and orphans and living above the world\'s standards (the James 1:27 definition of religion).\n\nNow, obviously not all scientific opinions are going to align perfectly with all religious beliefs. But it\'s important to remember three fundamental truths about science and religion:\n1. Scientists can be wrong and frequently are.\n2. Religious people can be wrong and frequently are.\n3. Most scientists, including an overwhelming majority of history\'s most notable scientists, are religious, and see no conflict between their intellection and their faith.\n\nAnother important thing to remember is that without conflict science cannot advance. If a religious belief inspires a person to take another look at a conventionally accepted scientific idea and think, ""This just isn\'t adequate,"" that\'s a GOOD thing. Copernicus didn\'t find the geocentric model of the universe adequate. Neither did Kepler. Newton didn\'t find Kepler\'s laws of planetary motion adequate. All of these either changed or enhanced the accepted scientific view, because the previous one was inadequate. The Jewish Torah inspired germ theory when one doctor realized that conventional medicine wasn\'t adequate, and there was certainly conflict when he presented that idea. There is still a surprising amount of conflict among seismologists over exactly how subduction zones work, but there is also a lot of advancement being made in earthquake preparation, warning and response programs because of this conflict. So if religion challenges science to continuously improve, how is that a bad thing?', ""I feel that religion and science are actually natural partners. We are both spiritual and material creatures. Also, speaking as a person of faith, I think that people who feel the two are mutually exclusive are not really thinking; they're just reacting against anything that opposes their pre-existing views. If they're religious, then they've taken all the mystery out of God and reduced God to a being fully knowable and understandable by humans, which is arrogant, blasphemous, and puts God in a box---nothing more to see here, folks. If, on the other hand, they're atheist, then they are saying we have the perfect knowledge system for understanding everything. In my view, this is also hubris. The universe is vastly mysterious, and we've had to update our thinking myriad times as our scientific understanding deepens.\n\nI work at a National Laboratory with some of the world's smartest and most creative scientists, and almost all of them are also religious. In science, one must remain open and unbiased (impossible for humans, but we are obliged to at least try) to see the real results and possibilities, or the research is suspect at best. In religion/faith, we must be honest in saying that our texts and views of the spiritual are limited by our material condition, and that our religious texts are merely the written records of the human experiences with the divine.\n\nNeither presents a complete picture, each represents a specific system of understanding our world, and the questions they inspire together are an Avenue for a fuller experience of both. One without the other leads us to exclude questions that we either might not the answers to or don't think are important to ask. Either way, it limits our exploration and that thwarts us at the most basic level. After all, what are humans if not explorers and questioners? One-sided, fearful, and controlling. Only at the intersection of science (the exploration of the material world) and faith (exploration of the spiritual world) are authentic, unblinking questions possible; and that is where the really interesting and important discoveries are."", ""First I would like to submit a definition of Fundamental. It is what it says literally the fundamentals of something; literally the core elements of a thing that should be learned first and are indespensible. For Christianity such things would be: a literal six day creation of the world, the Virgin birth of Christ, the fact that the man Jesus Christ was God ( present during and responsible for creation) as He said he was. The fact that he died as a sacrifice in place of humanity and then redirected Himself by His own power. More could potentially be added to this list but none can be taken away. If someone does not believe these things then it would be a misnomer to label them as Christian. Based solely on definition. To obscure a definition is to obscure the thing itself. At the fundamental level is point at which any idea or concept can no longer be broken down any further without losing it's identity. This much is fact and not subject to opinions. One could believe differently but that would not change what Christianity actually is and their Venn diagram would fall outside the circle."", 'The previous post is not meant to be offensive but I do believe that line needed to be in the sand if not for the sake of truth then at least for the sake of academics. The second thing I would like to submit is a definition of science. What it is and what it is not. Science/ Scientific Meathod is the observation, testing, hypothesizing, and retesting of things within our natural world until we gain sufficient data from which to draw conclusions. This is how we learn it is how we discover. The natural human curiosity. To do away with it would be to do away with all logic and reason which I might go so far as to say would be wrong, evil even if pushed to a certain extent. Now, what science by definition is not. Would be the beliefs and opinions ( theories if you insist on applying this label to that which is untested and unverified) of the ""scientific community"". If anyone reading this watched the movie Expelled. Then you will have to admit the great ideological suppression of anything that would contradict the current views. Consequently I would also like to submit a few facts. The evolutionary theory taught to those who are now 40-60. Has been completely disproved that\'s right. Most of the disproving was done by secular scientists also. But we have a new group of theories now so That isn\'t important. Although large amounts of those disproven theories are still being taught in classrooms as fact. Problem? Idk I\'m a religious person what would I know of such things. Even the original big bang theory that we are all so familiar with. The idea that nothing suddenly exploded into everything. Why would anyone believe that? Well because the math behind it is really complicated. Fair enough. However it was disproven. But rather than take it off the shelves it was amended so to speak. More than once. At the present time the theory does not even remotely resemble the one submitted by Mr. Steven Hawking. Kind of ruins the movie doesn\'t it. Also we have yet to observe a single mutation ( introduction of new genetic material due to coding error or any non intelligent outside stimulation)that is benifitial for the organizm. We can make mutants now that\'s a thing that is starting to come out of the closet. But we make them, and it\'s really difficult. Also there are no ""transitional forms"" (example: a fish with legs) anywhere in the fossil record. This alone disproves the whole thing but whatever. There are many fossils that are submitted as such but they are either disproven ( without being widely published as such) or they disappear or are not permitted to be examined. Seems a bit odd for something so important.', 'I would say that I subscribe to the philosophy of Martin Buber - one cannot use religion to explain science, nor science to explain religion. I do not personally believe the two are mutually exclusive, and one also needs to keep an open mind where faith is concerned. Religious faith is a tricky thing. There are many faiths in the world. It is a trap to think one\'s own faith is the only one that can possibly have truth. To me, that\'s the beauty of science. It is ""proven"" using the scientific method. Subject to impartial scrutiny, it seeks a neutral, objective truth.', ""I watched a show where someone said: If you learn more and find more answers in the area of Science, you could be more suprised and gratefull to God who made all those really crazy things. God made us, he gave us brains... so he wouldn't want us to stay stupid? He would wish it for us to become smart... and as long as science can't rule out the Almighty creator, what will never happen, science and religion are co-existing.\n\nGod made the whole big thing before it big banged. Why did it Big Bang? Because God wanted it to happen. Why did the one cellulair creature become more cellulair? Why turned apes into Homo Sapiens Sapiens? Because God wished it so. So everything what Darwin said happened, thanks to God who decided it to happen in that way... ( with giving us some free will). God made us, the beginning, and we are building the stones, the bricks, the walls, under his almighty eye.\n\nNo need for fighting. All those war-making creature should come over and listen to me. I would tell them exactly why it is like it is.\n\nAnd about God, I never said who he/she/it is. It can be everyones God, or it can be the father/mother of everyones bunch of Gods/godesses.""]","['General Topics', 'Spirituality & Philosophy']",Spirituality & Philosophy

383,447,Do Psychopaths Deserve to Find Love?,"[""There is a diverse variety of opinions out there about psychopaths and how they should be treated. Some see them as monsters who cannot be saved. Some see them as dangerous entities to be avoided. Some see them as people who have a disability. And some see them as the master race.\n\nThe question here is twofold: can a psychopath feel love, and does a psychopath deserve to be loved in return?\n\nDisclaimer: psychopaths make up a surprisingly large chunk of the population (about .6%), so there's a good chance one of the people on this site is a psychopath and knows it. If you are a psychopath and know it, please let us know and share your experience with love."", ""This is a moral question, and to even begin answering it in a meaningful way you need to establish a metaethical foundation. I've got one. Check your skype."", ""Isn't a psychopath defined as lacking empathy?\n\nDon't you need empathy to return love?\n\nI'm gonna say no. If you can't return it, then no."", ""Empathy is feeling what someone else is feeling just because they are feeling it. If two souls independently come to love one another, is that really any less meaningful than if one person induces it artificially in another? It's not the only perspective, but I think it's interesting to think of it that way. The other factor to consider is that empathy is not the same as compassion. Empathy is feeling what another feels. Compassion is understanding how another feelings, and caring about how they feel, but not feeling it yourself. Which is more important in a relationship?"", ""This feels like it is resting on top of an interesting discussion about whether or not empathy exists to begin with and, if it does to some degree, if it may be a byproduct of intuition. Along that line of thought, could it be that empathy (as in, relative empathy - I pretty strongly think that true empathy is impossible) is a trait of those who primarily experience and associate the world unconsciously, with psychopathy being a much more conscious range of experience/association? To be clear, I'm not at all trying to bring forth with this the idea that consciousness is more admirable than unconsciousness, rather I think that the hybridization of both is more useful than consistently leaning towards one or the other to any extreme degree.\n\nEdit: I guess I didn't even acknowledge the original question. I don't really feel like this can be answered because it seems like psychopathy can take a great number of forms and whether or not someone deserves something seems wholly like a matter of opinion."", 'Deserve? Irrelevant. Either happens or it does not happen. Do people who have done me wrong deserve to have the sun shine upon them?\n\nA better question might be can they find love?

If a dear friend of yours had the opportunity to date a psychopath, and asked for your advice, I imagine you'd tell them the same thing. And you'd discuss with them what you think the answers were, or how they should to about finding them, yes? So do you believe psychopaths can find love? Is that love sustainable? Do you think your friend could develop a healthy relationship with this person?"", ""I think that psychopaths could heal and develop the ability to have empathy and compassion and feel real loving attachment to someone (as opposed to the short lived dopamine high they feel) only if they want to. However they usually don't want to change so it's not possible. Do they deserve love? Well I think they have freewill and choose to stay that way and hurt people so no I don't think they deserve to be loved. They are to blame for their behaviour and are fully in control of it."", 'Psychopathy is not treatable. Though research is still in its early stages, the condition seems to be caused by lesions in the brain, specifically in the left medial temporal lobe and the orbitofrontal cortex.\n\nFor more evidence, review the work of Dr James Fallon, a neurobiologist whose study of psychopathic brains inadvertently revealed that he himself was a psychopath, much to his surprise, but apparently not to his family, who he loves and cares for to this day', ""psychopathy is a psychological disorder that can be treated\nevery human deserves to be loved\nalso lack of empathy doesn't mean no empathy at all\nmany people have psychopathic tendencies, that doesn't make them serial killers or really any kind of bad people\nit usually develops from childhood trauma and many of them seek help to function normally"", ""I believe it should depend on context. If they can truly care for another person and that other person care for them, then who can go against them? Everyone deserves love. Now if they are incapable of love than that's different. They of course need the love and support of their family, but if they cause pain to all those around them then introducing a new form of love in their life could be unimaginably painful for them and their potential lover."", 'I loved a covert narcissist. I loved him, I knew what he was eventually and I thought unconditional love could last even if we were not together. The problem is, like the mask they create for themselves, they create another for you. It seemed most of the time he was talking to this strawman he made of me who had all the same negative aspects and shames that he did. He was a cheater so I was too, he was manipulative so even if I had no idea what I was doing I was just manipulating him with love. Hmmmmm it seems there are too many people in this relationship. It has nothing to do what the partner can do for these types of people its what the Psychopath or B cluster type do for themselves. We cannot love enough, counsel enough or even problem solve enough someone who cannot face who they really are and do it for themselves. Trying to have adult relationships with traumatized children......no, you have to leave that to professionals who are completely detached. This type of person rarely seeks mental health help. Its called self love and its #1 for all who are going to have healthy relationships. :)', 'tru', 'This post would suggest they haven\'t already found it.\nWhat constitutes love? Psychopaths have been loved by others and many psychopaths love themselves. I envy that kind of self involvement. So is the question ""do they deserve to love someone back?""?', 'Psychopaths don\'t really feel love the way ""we"" do.\nWhile sociopaths can feel it with certain individuals, psychopaths are robbed of the core ability which would allow them to form a bond. By no fault of own, they were said to be born this way, even their brain is different if you look at the scans.\n\nI wouldn\'t say they don\'t ""deserve it"", but they can\'t return it, and like it or not, love is a trade, being happy its end goal. Besides, as they see the world as chess, their partner would likely be another piece on their board which they\'d attempt to manipulate to their will; - Their relationships do not generally go 50/50, or even close to that percentage, which is an issue few would wish to deal with.', ""Psychopaths don't feel love or emotions. They don't value it , they don't feel it. Their main motive is to make them feel good. They are self serving."", ""Yes- but with someone very specific- an empath whose emotional needs are already met, and who have nothing to offer the psychopath besides those qualities unique to empaths. The empath will know, and would have to know, everything that is going on, and because they have nothing to offer, it's impossible for the P to take advantage. If you look at this from society's perspective, it may be possible for the E to help the P. After all, particularly a violent P has seen trauma, and an empath is best equipped to help resolve that trauma and help them heal. After that, perhaps they can help the psychopath to find the area where they are most useful. There is research on how psychopaths make better judges, and soldiers (especially snipers, which requires a steady hand), and surgeons. I guess you could say i'm not so much interested in someone loving the psychopath as much as treating him.""]","['Psychology', 'General Topics']",General Topics

So if you don\'t have a photo you[re a man basically.\nWhy fuss. We\'re all men really, deep down inside.', ""I do think it's strange that the male/female section is hidden.

But that was M/M and platonic, I don't really know so much about dating and hetero pairings. I'm unsure if I ever really knew any ENTP females just INTP which works really well."", ""I know one and i think she'd be cool to hang out with but i wouldn't wanna date her. I think they'd make a good wing woman."", ""Now that's weird cause heard just the opposite. I heard that ENTP guys make the best wing men- go figure. And you're almost right about ENTP folks, you just got the gender wrong -you probably would NEVER want to date a ENTP guy- they're funny and everything and make good friends, but not great boyfriend material."", '', '', 'Yep, been there done that. Like all relationships, but I think especially in a entp x entp relationship, I think it\'ll only work if both parties are at the same level of maturity. In my case, I was more emotionally mature/my Fe was waaayy more developed than my partner - it was hard watching someone make exactly the same mistakes I made when I was younger. It was pretty hard to resist the urge to lecture him and be all like, ""Look dude, I\'ve been there. Please oh god, stop it, do ___ instead.""\n\nFelt more like an extremely good platonic friendship than a romantic relationship, to be honest. In short, I think it\'d be a really good friendship, but I\'m not sure romantic-wise. But then who knows, maybe that\'s confirmation bias.', ""As ENTP, I do like ENTP guy.\nMy parents are both ENTP and they got along really well to be honest. Free from any kind of drama. Then, my ENTP sister were born and about a year later I was born as ENTP as well. My family is really perfect and dynamic to me right now. There's no mushy gushy feelings since we're all brutally honest."", ""I've contacted 5 ENTP females my age on other sites. One didn't seem to be anything like an ENTP. Two had profiles that were very ENTP. One didn't return my massage. The other was instantly no connection. I assume she was writing with her thumbs and so came across as not very bright, very flaky sounding. I could only hang for a a couple messages. The last 2 were Russian and maybe it's a Russian thing but their minds were very closed on the few subjects we discussed. They seemed angry from the start and just got more so.\n\nSo based on my experience with ENTP women (and other types too) I think whether someone would make a good partner has much more to do with developed skilled than base MBTI attributes."", ""I'm into ENTP men. I like the BS ones, the funny ones, even though I see through a lot of BS, their ability to trigger emotion amuses me. They make the best flirts out of all NT, I think.\n\nWether such a thing could be lasting, no idea.

389,454,"""You're Overreacting""","['When my feelings or values are threatened or invalidated, I tend to react strongly. When others cannot see things from my perspective, it is a horribly isolating feeling and I instantly seek others to validate my point of view, or I retract my statements entirely. I recognize when the other person will simply not make an effort to understand where I\'m coming from. Although I am usually nuanced in my way of thinking, at this point of stress it feels like other people either ""get it"" or they don\'t, and I quickly lose patience for those who don\'t get it.\n\nIn these situations, INFP\'s can become angry, frantic, stark, and/or cold, as our underdeveloped Extraverted Thinking (Te) dominates the stage, masking everything about us that is soft, considerate, and open minded.\n\nThis is often unexpected, shocking, or even hurtful to another party who is most familiar with the healthy INFP\'s sweetly musing demeanor. Make no mistake, we are no doormat.\n\nWhen the line is crossed and I am hurt, the other person often tells me I am overreacting...Unless of course they are part of my most trusted circle. My trusted circle (let\'s call them ""tribe"") knows the depth of me, the light of me, and everything in between. They know not to judge my feelings or reactions. They know my reactions are authentic and come from a place of passion, a sense of injustice, a place of insecurity, or a broken heart. They listen and they understand, and because they themselves know their own darkness, they have a knight-like bravery in the face of mine. Exposure to my demons is not harmful to them. In fact they have often encouraged me to open up. It is normal and important for them to be present as I process my emotions.\n\nIt has been so meaningful to find people who hold space for me in a time of need. My whole life, I have been one of two things: Not Expressive Enough, or Too Expressive in the eyes of others.\n\nI think in my entire life, I have NEVER told anyone that they are overreacting...It adds insult to injury and stunts emotional intelligence of those who refuse to acknowledge another\'s experience. I mean, what is an appropriate reaction anyway? One that is pleasing to the other person? One that is suppressed, fermented in a cold cellar, becoming increasingly toxic over time?\n\nSo in conclusion of this meandering ramble, I say that in most cases, INFPs are reacting JUST FINE. Some exceptions to this are manipulative or abusive behavior, so as long as we are aware when we cross the line and hold ourselves accountable, I think we\'re doing alright. Although we are highly individualistic and may seem detached at times, we are deeply in tune with the human spirit. Our passion reflects this and I don\'t think we should change this about ourselves.', ""I've been hit with that line several times in the last few days alone. Though, I get the feeling that many of us (INFPs, turbulent in particular) found out about the MBTI because of this phenomena particular."", 'Overreacting is a clumsy word, but it is the word with which we are stuck. Generally we say it of someone where the reaction not only does not help resolving the problem, but impedes any attempt by the opposite party to resolve it.\n\nThe removal of the battlefield from the impersonal to the inter-personal creates many challenges for problem resolution. When INFPs prefer inter-personal discussion, it is not only because they believe in the reality of the phenomenological world more intensely than the everyman. It is a kind of ""slave religion"" way of functioning. The esoteric battlefield is preferable because it is where they are most powerful.\n\nThe demand, that their esoteric moods be understood as a precondition to conflict resolution, and without the mediation of impersonal ""rules of engagement,"" gives the INFP power to control the discussion, but kills rather than resolves any given issue. It kills the argument by leading to disassociation from the ""inter-subjective"" framework. It replaces that framework with an introspective one, expressed only in terms of cryptic behaviour and language, which obfuscate the connection between symbol and meaning for anyone except the INFP herself.\n\nThe value framework of Fi, which is the advocate, judge and jury of whatever cause it seeks to defend, does not require external input. Ultimately when threatened, the INFP is always right, within whatever introspective line of advance the INFP chooses to champion. The INFP always wins the inner battle against the outsider. But she cannot win the argument.\n\nLashing out with Te has less to do with an attempt to create a convincing argument, as much as the sense of exhilarating aggression created by the experience. It\'s literally ""ex-pression,"" the expulsion of compressed sentiments in an explosion of personal energy.\n\nWhether that makes it ""just fine"" depends on the object this behaviour seeks to attain. It\'s probably helpful to psychological balance that this happens, but I will say bluntly that for other people, it is usually experienced as a very negative encounter with the INFP\'s defense mechanism. This is just something that people who know and love INFPs have to deal with.', ""I've had people tell me that I overreact or and least get the impression that they want to say it to me it puts me on the defensive.\n\nI think that if anyone tells you that you are overreacting, they are assuming that they know how you feel and what is going on with you internally, perhaps better than you do. I don't think anyone can every truly know that since they aren't you. Even if they think they are right to say something along those lines, the wording invalidates your feelings and not meeting you were you are at.\n\n"", 'this feels familiar. Very familiar.\n\nIt\'s taken me the better part of my life to realise that sometimes, people are right.\n\nNo not saying we have a tendency to overreact, just that SOMEtimes we don\'t realise how strongly we are reacting (aka overreacting) until we step away from the issue or the problem and look at with cool eyes later in the day or week or month or year.\n\nI\'ve had things play back in my mind and wonder, why? Just, why? Can\'t even remember.\n\nIf you can\'t remember exactly why you reacted a certain way. If it doesn\'t make sense anymore after a while. If it almost seems like it was someone else not you. Like in another life. Then chances are, you overreacted.\n\nIt\'s not so much that there is something wrong with overreacting, any more than there\'s something wrong with \'over eating\' or \'over drinking\' or \'over sleeping\'. But if you put yourself in the shoes of the other people who have a different temperament than you do, it is very hard for them not to notice if your reaction seems to be above what they are used to or what they would normally express themselves, and if they are the vocal type, or the type that values facts (and pointing them out) over feelings and sensitivities, they will say so.\n\nIt drove me nuts for years. And then I got to the point where I just keep my reaction to myself and act on it, as opposed to expressing it. So for example, if someone lets me down, in a way that I cannot see past at that moment (or, ever) I \'react\' by simply not talking to them. I won\'t say why, I won\'t get into a whole thing, I\'ll just cut them out of my life. It serves the same purpose (reacting) without any of the angst or the ""oh you\'re"" this, ""oh you\'re"" that.\n\nSome might call that overreacting but I don\'t even think of it in those terms anymore. It\'s very simple. You hurt me/my feelings, and I feel like you don\'t care and it won\'t matter what I say anyway, you\'re gone. Problem solved. One can\'t say you\'re overreacting if there\'s nothing to react, to.\n\nSo that\'s how I deal with it. It works well. In the general public, in situations where I can\'t avoid the interaction, I just walk away, instead of getting into an exchange. I\'ve developed the ability to say ""what do you want"" to people when I can tell they\'re annoying me, as a way of cutting it short, as in ok let\'s just get down to what can or can\'t be done. Or ""I don\'t want to talk about this"" I actually said that to someone today. It\'s very simple. It\'s basically saying, No. Which we should all learn.\n\nMy two cents :). This might change with time.']","['Romantics ', 'Personality', 'INFP - Healer']",INFP - Healer

Take a look at the academic work described at http://www.yourmorals.org/ . Try the Moral Foundations Questionnaire and report your results here.', ""Well i guess about political differences it wouldn't be a problem because improving your Mbti type means letting go of things and wrong ways of thinking, negative ideas, acceptance, .... But cultural differences lies partly on religions ... the main problem with Mbti = it explains that some people don't really speak or express the same way in some circumstances, so if you have the other's notice ...it tends to be easier but it's still the same problem with open-minds or narrow-minds. As long as you accept others ideas and you don't try to force them going your way meaning respecting them, then there are no problems... maybe it would tend to uniformation of culture by the way..\n\nSame with politics as long as people are free to choose, there would be no meaning having so many laws so many restrictions since no one would juge the others for what they would have done BUT well we would live like animals then rules of the stronger i guess ..."", 'Moral Foundations Theory correlated with Big Five personality traits: http://individual.utoronto.ca/jacobhirsh/publications/Hirsh_DeYoung_Xu_Peterson_2010.pdf', ""I still think this would be a great strategic pivot for projectevolove ??a chance to outdo the dating site that boasts ?œSubstance ??Not Just Selfies??and a chance to do something for science. ;-)\n\nWe know that the Myers-Briggs crowd is not averse to answering long questionnaires.

391,456,Trump Brings Prestige to the Mail Order Bride Industry.,"['For years, International Marriage Services had to live with the stigma of being referred to as Mail Order Bride services. However, many consider the term ""mail-order bride"" derogatory and feel it demeans foreign women by comparing them to commodities for sale and falsely implying that (unlike local women), they exercise no judgment over the men they meet and would marry anyone from a relatively wealthy country. Even with the foreign women being labeled as mail order brides these companies have grown in popularity for the past two decades, largely due to the internet. The industry grew at such a fast pace it caught the attention of the US senator Maria Cantwell of Washington State, who in 2006 she pushed a bill through congress known as IMBRA or International Marriage Brokers Regulation Act. Although the intent of Senator Cantwell was clearly meant to put Foreign Bride Companies out of business by severely restricting how men communicate with foreign women.

Since Trump announced his candidacy for president of the United States, the industry saw a significant increase in upscale business men looking for foreign brides. Once he became president, Trump made it the new status symbol of success to be married to an eastern European women. With First Lady Melanie Trump in the White House, opinions about foreign women have dramatically changed. Once men were scorned upon to be married to a women from Russian or the Ukraine, now is seen as prestigious. And we are seeing huge increase of men seeking foreign brides, our client base is up by more than 200% since Trump has taken office. This month alone we will be taking over 100 American men to the Ukraine, mostly very successful executives."" Beside online matchmaking, the company arranges group tours for men that will travel to countries throughout the world. During these tours the men will meet hundreds of pre-screened women during what A Foreign Affair calls ""Social Events"" or what Kenneth calls speed dating on steroids.\n\nCritics say these women are just used as arm trophies for business men in America. That men take advantage of the women\'s circumstances, both economical and geographical. Kenneth argues, ""I would hardly say Melanie Trump has been taken advantage of or refer her to as a Mail Order Bride. Women choose just like the men choose, we are all adults and are responsible for our own choices. It is just that men in America have a good reputation for the way we treat women and how we take care of our families. This opens the door to the men to meet some of the most beautiful women in the world.""\n\nTrump is not the only high profile person to marry a foreign women, Jeb Bush met his wife in Mexico.

And if someone doesn't believe that there's some truth to MBTI, then what on earth are they doing on this website in the first place?"", 'I work with science and pseudoscience on a daily basis + I\'ve studied psychology and MBTI was addressed there, so I\'m probably qualified to tell what\'s wrong with MBTI. From a scientific standpoint, there are 6 problems that I can think of right now. Let\'s begin by saying that the main criticism stems from organizational psychology (not personality psychology):\n1) Reliability: When MBTI was tested as a tool for selecting new employees, some people got different MBTI results when retested (which means there\'s an issue with scientific reliability). -\n2) Validity: A) When MBTI was analyzed through a process, called statistical ""factor analysis"" (FA), it turned out that there should be 6 temperaments and not 4. FA also found a lot of differences that were not accounted for by MBTI; B) Correlations were found between types that should not exist according to MBTI. Altogether, that means there\'s a big issue with the scientific validity of MBTI. -\n3) When used to hire employees, studies have found that MBTI type has no effect on success within an occupation, which means that MBTI falls short as a selection tool for hiring employees. -\n4) There are problems with the underlying theory. For example, the function stacks are not measurable and therefore not falsifiable (= verifiable), which means that that part of MBTI is pseudoscience. -\n5) The Barnum/Forer Effect: This effect says that as long as descriptions are vague enough, they can apply to anyone. To add to that, it\'s scientifically proven that we are generally bad at assessing our own personality (e.g. Dunning-Kruger effect). That fact combined with the Forer effect means personality typing in general is a risky business, which means that scientific reliability and validity is necessary to bypass those problems, and that is what the MBTI lacks.\n6) There is evidence that ambiversion is a real, which is a concept that MBTI rejects as you\'re either I or E. This non-dimensional way of measuring personality traits is a problem because really nothing works like that; There is always some overlap between two opposing factors (e.g.: hot vs cold: where does cold transition into hot?) and most people of the overall population should be in this overlapping zone because the population can be described with Bell curve for spectral traits like I-E. This overlapping zone would be ambiversion in the context of MBTI.\n\nAltogether, there are definitely legitimate concerns from a scientific standpoint, but from my years of experience with MBTI, I feel that outsiders are too quick to generalize the Forer effect onto MBTI as I do think that MBTI type descriptions are detailed enough. Also, it\'s clear that MBTI fails as a tool for hiring employees, but then we\'re ignoring the fact that MBTI has other uses too: E.g.: self-exploration and I do feel like MBTI is a good tool for that, even if FA found some issues with that. In conclusion, as a scientist myself, I concede that MBTI is not a scientific tool and that is should not be used as such, but that is no problem to me because there already is a tool that meets the reliability and validity requirements (The Big Five personality tool), which is why I view MBTI as nothing else but an imperfect tool for self-exploration. Regarding the horoscopes, anyone with familiar with MBTI knows that it is nothing like horoscopes, so I wouldn\'t pay attention to that.', ""^\n3) When used to hire employees, studies have found that MBTI type has no effect on success within an occupation, which means that MBTI falls short as a selection tool for hiring employees. -\n4) There are problems with the underlying theory.

Hollowing the movement means taking out excess material (or at least removing the material that can be removed), while Richard Miller does a lot of different things.\n\nThe construction of the entire building takes into account the lightness that is embodied in the structure of the movement.

398,463,INTJ and ESFJ relationship experiences?,"[""Recently ended a 9 month relationship with an ESFJ female. Was wondering if anyone could express their personal experiences with the same match. I had a great amount of respect and deeply cared for this person. I admired the amount of loyalty, motivation, and caring that came with her personality. When things were going well we got along great. However, I had hundreds of nonsensical arguments with her over such trivial things that seem too ridiculous to even describe. The smallest things would lead to hour long discussions of me speaking objectively and her putting subjective feelings and emotions on par with logic. I know INTJs can come across as cold and uncaring, but I think that's a superficial view. I studied her personality in depth and tried my best at not providing solutions in conflicts and did my best at simply listening to her and providing non judgmental support. Despite my best efforts, once an argument started, it was never settled in a short period, and always led to her taking hours to recover from a negative mood. I couldn't understand why she couldn't drop things that were so unimportant.\nI felt like the life was being sucked out of me because of the amount of effort I put into trying to make things work with her. I am confident when I say I could probably get along with any other personality type better than her if she represents a typical esfj. What's strange is that my best female friend is also an esfj, and we get along great. I think she would drive me insane in an intimate relationship though.\nHave any of you experienced similar situations with this type? We came back to each other several times hoping to make things work, but I am honestly so happy to see what else is out there, because I think matching with any other type would be a thousand times easier."", 'Not the same match but as an INTJ who had a relationship end extremely badly. Depending on how yours ended, you will be in for a rough road learning to trust again. *salutes*', ""Appreciate the kind words, thanks. I doubt I'll have trouble trusting again, I won't project the issues of the past person onto the next one. I can relate to a devastating breakup though, I went through one of those over seven years ago, and I still think about the person. I never knew her personality type, but I did study quite a bit and learned that she was a textbook definition of a narcissist, which made letting things go easier for me. It's easy to be drawn to narcissists because they can portray such perfection on the exterior, while being terrible and shameful inside.\nWhat was your experience, or at least, what was their personality type?"", 'Beg pardon, but dating a SF was your first mistake. If you can, stick to N types, and NT types, if you can find them. Hard to find as NT males outnumber NT females like 3 to 1. ST types might also work for you, if the individual is logical and mature. I have also dated a number of SF types in my life. Was married to one for a long time. After that I dated a woman who I pegged as ISFP (my polar opposite) for 3 years. We had a blast for a time, but she got bored. Needs constant change and stimulation. Reviewing the MBTI has opened up my eyes to some aspects of compatibility and dating. This has a practical application in laying groundwork for long-term understanding and compatibility. Good luck going forward!', ""I agree with Techie1. Stick with Ts, or even better NTs. Ideally date another INTJ. And then you may get a sense of what it's like for the rest of us. Lol"", 'I don\'t mean that to sound horrible. I just think the best way for INTJs to learn considering your Ni and Te is first hand experience of a very serious relationship with, yourselves, i.e. another INTJ. And then even if you can\'t empathise at least you\'ll know from experience using your Dom Ni what it feels like and what is likely to happen when you do certain things, or don\'t do certain things.\n\nLike what I\'m doing now, qualifying what I just said. I don\'t have to. And you might not think it\'s necessary. Maybe you wouldn\'t do it. But I\'m doing it because I care how you feel in relation to what I just said. And that is important in relationships with SFJs. SFJs appreciate concrete gestures of care and love and appreciation, especially appreciation..\nUnfortunately, in my experience at least, trying to know what an INTJ really feels is like looking in a crystal ball and hoping it will tell you the future. And that can be very frustrating for a personality type that needs the exact opposite, i.e. show me, tell me. So I can see how a lot of petty fights would arise, probably all stemming from the same sense of, ""I don\'t know what the hell you\'re thinking I don\'t know if you even love me..."" (I\'m imagining what it\'s like to be in that SFJ\'s shoes I\'ve never been in a relationship with a INTJ type).', ""thanks techie and cyanara for your viewpoints. I'm not sure a relationship with an intj would prove to be very beneficial. INTJs tend to be extremely introspective, even to an unhealthy degree. Seeking a relationship with someone who has the same personality characteristics for the sole purpose of educating myself on my deficiencies would probably be redundant and unnecessary. I could be wrong, but I doubt that's a solution.\nI do agree that I continually failed to meet the standards that were expected in the relationship with the esfj. I have come to the conclusion that it was simply a bad match. I could've eventually cracked the code and provided what she needed, but it would be forced and unnatural. It would be an attempt to alter my very personality. No partner should expect that of another, if they do, it's a bad relationship to begin with.\nI think my original intent on beginning this post was to see if there were other intj/esfj matches that made it work, and if so, how they overcame their differences.\nCyanara, I agree with most of what you said in the last paragraph. I don't think there's even much point in discussing what both people could have done to better communicate their needs. The bottom line is that she isn't changing who she is, and neither am I, nor should we. So, in that case, I don't believe there really is a right or wrong. I did value logic over emotion in arguments, which makes this kind of confusing, because even though I may have generally been the level headed one, that's not how relationships work. I did need to value her sfj needs more (and did learn to much more often), but I honestly don't care to, because to do so would be to change who I am. I was never anything but loving towards her, but her personality needs constant reassurance which is completely pointless, and even unattractive in an INTJs mind."", '"" I could\'ve eventually cracked the code and provided what she needed, but it would be forced and unnatural. It would be an attempt to alter my very personality. No partner should expect that of another, if they do, it\'s a bad relationship to begin with.""\n\nI agree.\n\nI am glad you posted this chain, and responded to my post. Helps me understand INTJs better.\n\nHopefully someone with relevant experience will find this and give you a more helpful answer.', ""I was in a relationship with an ESFJ for a few months and it was honestly painful. He was basic and liked things to be simple. I'm complex and enjoy intellectual conversations. Adventuring together was fun because of the E and I, as I say that every kite needs a kite-string and every kite-string needs a kite, but that's about where the fun ended. Even sex was basic. ESFJs are wonderful people but they are the MB version of quarterback and cheerleader, and as an INTJ woman, I am far from being a cheerleader."", ""LOL and whatever you do, no, do not date another INTJ! You'd never leave the house.\n\nKite &gt; Kite-string\nKite-string &gt; Kite\n\nThe only trait you should really keep in the N, everything else is just seeing how the two of you fit together :) Which might take a damn life-time to find as seems to be my case, but at least it hasn't been boring! (except for that guy who was boring)."", ""Generally painful, I'd agree with that. I focused mainly on the positives which is why it lasted so long. I can understand the basic and simple comment. She was more of a conforming type, heavily influenced by outsiders, liked mundane conversations about people, and was not spontaneous. I'm definitely non-conforming, not easily influenced, and despise clichÃ©d conversations.

399,464,INFP's dealing with the end of a relationship.,"['So pretty self explanatory really. I was recently seeing someone for a few months, I\'m not sure what personality type she was...though looking back perhaps she was a bit too much on the judgemental side of things for me.\n\nI had some doubts about the ability of this relationship to last anyway, I liked her a lot and was having fun but we did have some challenges I suppose. Anyway, she broke up with me and told me she\'d been seeing someone else, which is obviously not nice for anyone.\n\nI don\'t blame her for braking up with me, like I said I had my doubts too, but that was not a very good way to go about it.\n\nNow, I\'m quite a typical INFP I think....I don\'t have a lot of relationships, I select people carefully, but when I get in I\'m all in so to speak. I\'ve broken up with people before of course, but always on more agreeable terms, i.e we talked and decided it probably wasn\'t working. I\'m generally still friends with most of my ex\'s.\n\nAnyway, this experience has thrown me off a bit which is part of the reason I\'m here....the questions I\'m asking myself are ""what do I need to look out for in a partner to avoid this kind of situation again? (lies, cheating ect) "" and ""how do I learn to fully trust someone again?"".\n\nSo I\'m wondering if any similar types to myself have ever been through something similar, or if anyone has any advice to share?\n\nThanks in advance.', ""Thanks for sharing :)\n\nThere's only select few people that really want to commit, especially before their 30s it seems. Those highschool sweethearts stories are rare too. Would you consider what you had a relationship really, or just ''dating''?\n\nI can relate well with going ''all-in'' once you set your mind / feeling on someone. In this case you learned sooner than later that this person was a very bad fit for you (also considering that cheating or switching over to another dude immediately). Better have it happen within a few months than a few years down the line, i'd say.\n\nThen again you can never know with people anyway, as life changes, throwing them challenges. You can be happily settled with one person and everything going well for years ..., and suddenly they start acting out or messing up. It eats away at your ability to trust people next time.\n\nIdk, if I ever find myself in a relationship again I will surely go ''all-in'' again, but trying to enjoy the moment and enjoy life as it is, as opposed to fantasising and idealising that it will be forever. I mean, I never doubted myself in that regard :p so as long as you dont doubt yourself and dont have regrets you're all good!"", 'Thanks for that! And I agree, much better to find out sooner rather than later....\n\nI don\'t think I mind so much the idea that relationships sometimes end, I\'m ok with that. I just hate the dishonesty, I like people to be fairly direct with me I suppose. If she\'s said she didn\'t think it was working, broken up with me as nicely as she could then met someone else I would feel much better about the whole thing.\n\nHmmm, at the moment I think I\'m at the ""very much regret having met her"" phase, but that\'ll pass and I\'ll end up being glad of some happy memories and move on!', ""It's too general a question without knowing the full background of your story to comment on. My guess is you were too clingy and she pulled away from having to take you on as a full-time job."", ""errr, I wasn't asking why she broke up with me though thanks for you opinion! You're wrong of course, but hey.\n\nThe question was about how INFP people deal with a bad break up and learn to trust people again. Sorry if that wasn't clearer."", 'Maybe trust your intuition more? I can generally ""feel"" if someone is worth my time or not these days...but on the other hand, I\'ve also learned that life is just unpredictable. You can\'t protect yourself from everything, and even if you could, it wouldn\'t be a very meaningful way to go through life.\n\nWithout sounding too dismissive, I have found that time does a good deal of healing (hard to see that right now though), and you\'ll eventually meet someone that will want to make you trust again...seems harder to do the older we get (for INFP\'s anyway), but I guess we just keep putting one foot in front of the other.', ""Having dated an INFP myself, I guess this is where truly gambling your trust comes in a bit\n\nTo answer your first question: always check for social cues. Being a feeler, this should be your forte (I assume). So just check for recurring patterns, things not lining up, having dodgy behavior, If certain questions raise tension or have similar negative effects, those should raise a lot of red flags for you\n\nSecond question: if i had a solid answer I would tell you but I guess I am here on this dating site to learn myself. Trusting people is never easy and having the best person I ever met in my life suddenly ghost on me and stab me in the back is hard. Still, the world moves on. Time keeps going. Everything we do has a value which can never be regained. I loved her but apparently she didn't so what can I do. The fact that I am still standing and willing to get back into the game means that there's still a bit of trust left in me still. So just chin up and keep moving forward and little by little, you will learn how to trust again"", 'I just had an INFP male ghost me. He seemed very into me but when I told him I was into him too and wasn\'t playing games, I even wanted a relationship with him. He said that I ""scare"" him. Since his type isn\'t a direct communicate type, he finally told me he\'s not ready for a relationship that it stresses him out too much. As an INTJ female I don\'t get hurt too easily, but this hurt. I\'m crushed. So I told I\'ll let him go and told him to take care of himself. I\'m walking away, but every part of me wants him. The worst part is I think he totally misunderstood. A relationship to me isn\'t moving in getting married and making the world revolve around us. We could have gone on years living separately and only seeing each other on weekends. I think he panicked for no reason.']","['Romantics ', 'Personality', 'INFP - Healer']",INFP - Healer

Never tried it though (I don't think).\n\nI would just worry that, though we would certainly respect and challenge each other, it would miss that deep emotional aspect that INTJs tend to need drawn out of them.\n\nAyn Rand described a utopia of INTJs, but it seemed so idealistic I can't quite believe it could work without something missing.

I'm still convinced that a complementary relationship with an enfp, entp, or esfp would probably be more fulfilling. who knows though? Maybe understanding each other's strengths deeply could act as a springboard for tackling each other's weaknesses together.\nI clinged onto Rand's objective teachings a decade ago. Her teachings are a breath of fresh air in a world that doesn't value logic. Check out the psychological concept of splitting. even as an intj, I think it's important to recognize the value in having a balance. Things aren't black and white, and I think a complementary relationship would more likely provide contentment. I would still like to meet an intj woman though."", ""I've somehow managed to meet 3 different INTJ women. We only went on a few dates each though.

401,466,The Return of Offline Matchmaking Services to the Dating Scene,"[""Online or Offline? The Return of Offline Matchmaking Services to the Dating Scene\n\n\nOnline dating has become the norm for dating in recent years. With a few swipes, you can get yourself a date for Saturday night, all on the screen of your smart phone. However, offline dating is slowly starting to gain traction once again as more and more people are starting to realize how easy it is to get tricked by a pretty photo, or hyped up personal information found on an online dating site.\n\n\nOpinions from dating forums and personal forums show that the most common complaint by men is that women?™s photos on their profiles don?™t match up to how they look in real life. Because of the convenience of filters and a well angled camera, it has become easier for people to drastically change their appearance as seen on their online presence. It?™s also becoming easier for people to take more photos of themselves and choose the one that displays their best physical features to their advantage.\n\nFor women, the most common complaint from them is the fact that men tend to exaggerate their financial statuses on online dating sites. Women decide to go on a date with these men, thinking that they are financially capable of taking care of themselves and their significant other.\n\nSo they go out, have a nice dinner, nice conversation about interests, politics, and business forum topics, but when it comes to picking up the check, he makes the woman pay for it, says he?™ll take care of the tip, but only leaves 3%. These are also the type of people you see zipping around in a BMW or a Lexus, only to find out that they still live in their parents??basement.\n\nWomen say that men don?™t care about the more important things, and only care about superficial qualities, like physical appearance. Men complain that women only care if a man is wealthy or not. Whatever the main complaints are, the ease of access of online dating has made it easier for men and women alike to be pickier about their dating choices. The prevalence of dating advice on love forums only serves to enhance the mentality that you must be as picky as possible when it comes to choosing your significant other.\n\nTo address some of these complaints, some sites have started implementing certain precautionary measures. For example, some websites have tried implementing ID verification. While this is a great way of verifying an individual's identity, this does not help with verifying an individual?™s facial features, or their financial status.\n\nSome sites have tried implementing video call to encourage its members to connect with each other and see what they look like over live video call. While this is a simple solution to the problem, not many people are comfortable with live video call, and choose to opt out on that particular option.\n\nSo many people have lost their faith in internet dating for these very reasons, and are slowly starting to embrace offline dating once again. For the younger generation, they find that the best way to find a long lasting relationship is through personal interactions, like introduction by a mutual friend, parties, bars, concerts, etc. But for the older generation, personal introductions are hard to come by sometimes. Almost everyone they know is in a committed relationship, busy with their careers, or their children.\n\nThis is where offline dating options come in, and these are making a splash in their reintroduction to the dating industry. More niches of offline dating are starting to become more popular, from speed dating to hiring a matchmaker to set you up on a date. Dating coaches are becoming a popular option as well, with people paying a professional for love advice and to help them meet and attract potential partners.\n\nOne of the more interesting offline dating options is through the romance tour or the international foreign bride system. These services are the perfect combination of offline and online dating. They have men sign up for their website, where they are given access to numerous pages of women who are registered under that particular website. These women are usually screened beforehand to guarantee their identity and their motivations.\n\nThey can choose to chat and interact with any of the women who pique their interest. Once they decide to take their relationship offline, men have the option of attending the romance tour affiliated with the company to meet them in person. These romance tours typically take place in international sites, such as Russia, Asia, South America, etc., which provides an exotic backdrop to your potential love story.\n\nAnd if this particular romance doesn?™t work out, they have the opportunity to get introduced to hundreds of women and find their potential significant other. These romance tours have helped many men and women find and meet each other.\n\nAlthough online dating offers you the best convenience of meeting a potential significant other, nothing beats the very real spark of connection of two people meeting in person for the very first time."", 'The Breitling watch company got started back in 1884 in the mountains of Switzerland as a company that http://www.vetsonwhl.co.uk/vetsonwhl.html made precision counters and chronographs for the http://www.usarmygermany.com/postinfo.asp scientific and industrial community.

402,467,Things Romantic Movies Get Wrong About Relationships,"['Pop media does not always portray realistic relationships. Most romantic stories are written to make viewers empathetic, but are often just made-up fantasies. Sure, you might see a boy chasing after a girl in a subway, like they do in movies; but unlike in movies, they don?™t usually end with a kiss. In real life, it ends with a restraining order against the guy. That?™s just one thing that romantic movies get wrong about relationships.\n\nAnother example is how there always has to be a third party, a rival for true love, a love triangle. Romantic movies introduce such characters in order to add tension and conflict (which I understand are needed to tell an engaging story), but most real-life relationships are already beset by common problems such as debt, bills, and whose turn is it to take out the trash. Not all real-life relationships have a love triangle, and if some do, then it?™s usually resolved during the courtship stage.\n\nSpeaking of debt and bills, why is it that there?™s always a difference in status between the couple? Like how the guy is a rich, pampered descendant of a Welsh royal?”King Arthur himself even?”and the girl is just from down the corner of Edison, New Jersey, or vice versa. It just adds more fantasy to the story.\n\nBut despite all of my gripes about what romantic movies get wrong about relationships, I still enjoy watching them. I have fun rooting for the guy chasing for the girl in the subway. I celebrate when the guy triumphs over the rival and wins the girl?™s hand. I swoon when the man of lordly caliber sweeps the pauper girl off of her feet and marries her despite the gap in their station. I enjoy romantic movies for what they are?”made-up fantasies.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on good romantic movies that portray relationships realistically? Let me know.', 'In real life, only something like 17% of counteies marry based on romantic live. ;-)', 'Yeah, a lot of movies also encourage the idea that the woman will always fall in love with the persistent ""good guy"" in the end. This doesn\'t correspond to reality as usually if a woman is not attracted to a guy at first, it doesn\'t change just because he hangs around and tries to befriend her. I think this narrative does both men and women a disservice by giving false hope to men - which also puts women in awkward situations when her male friends think they can ""win her over"".', 'I completely agree. The only purely good people are asexual.', 'And I am sorry to say that there are a lot of ""messed up"" women that are attracted to ""bad boys"". Usually the so-called bad boys have a tendency to be selfish. And the women who like that type do not seem to care. And to be fair, there are a lot of messed up guys out there, too. Abusers, ""playahs"", etc. Ben Franklin summed it up loke this in Poor Richard\'s Almanack - ""One good man is worth 2 good women - because the more rare a thing is, the more valuable.', 'I think ""Love, Actually"" is a good movie that portrays relationships in all its facets.', ""It's idealized. Who wants to see movie after movie where nobody gets together or it becomes abusive? I would think the long term friend shifting into relationship isn't quite realistic at all.\n\nAnd we're online. Statistically speaking, online dating is how most people meet only after meeting through friends. You don't se much about that in movies."", 'Saying a good man is rare, and saying a good man is worth two good women, are two very different things, Techie1. There are statistically more women than men in the world, therefore statistically men are rarer, bad or good, but a man isn\'t ""worth"" two women.', 'I think Ben Franklin\'s comment isn\'t placing individual human worth making men ""better"" than women. I think his comment is, in fact, that women tend to be more loyal and committed in relationships (at the time, marriages) than men. Further, that ""good"" men are more rare to find than good women. I realize you come from a country outside of the US. You might consider Googling ""Benjamin Franklin"" and/or ""Poor Richard\'s Almanack"" to get an idea of the historical content. The comment is circa 1750 or so. The Almanack is chocked full of ""homespun"" wisdom that I\'m sharing. However, in truth, much of it comes from mythology, or ancient Greek and Roman philosophers.', ""I think, realistically, anything can happen.\nSure, all of those things (such as the persistent good guy winning, the couple of different statuses getting together, the love triangles, etc.) that romantic movies portray are always exaggerated or usually not seen in real life, but fantasy has a basis in realistic possibilities.\nSo maybe they don't show the usual case scenario for relationships, but there's nothing stopping the things they emphasize from actually happening. :)\nIn any case, though yes, you mostly have to deal with everyday things like who to take out the trash and how you're going to pay the bills, there's always room for some romance. There's a bit of both. Romantic movies just focus on one side more to play on people's heart strings :)"", ""I personally think that movies as well as books that relate with the genre of romance deviate intentionally from what we would consider 'normal' according to the rules of our society and that it's perfectly fine. What it's emphasized (and I am generalizing) are the apposite spheres that the protagonists are placed in the beginning (rich - poor / secure - reserved / happy - with past trauma etc.), their depth of character, their progressive development as well as their sacrifices, as those spheres collide and merge with each other. Of course, finally everything culminates with them experiencing pure love.\nThe reason why we might feel that these movies are exaggerated it's because maybe we haven't invested enough time looking into spheres that are different than our own.\nLastly, I strongly believe that a relationship shouldn't be formed just for the sake of having one or because of peer pressure. It should be based on depth, intimacy and shared responsibility.""]",['Dating & Relationships'],Dating & Relationships

404,469,Food for thought on Activism,"['Lately I\'ve been having some discussions with a few friends about the power of protest, the importance of activism and the necessity of action. The more I talk about this topic, the more I feel that there really is no clear cut answer when it concerns finding your role. Does everyone need to participate in activism? Does being neutral make you a contributor? Well, in theory, yes. However, lately I\'ve been more focused on the idea that we all have our own talents, and our own natural inclinations. Not everyones protest needs to look the same. Not everyone needs to go out onto the streets and participate in person, not everyone needs to write regular posts countering oppression, and not everyone needs to run fundraising events. I have at least a couple of friends who have literally been the rose that grew from concrete, growing out of poverty despite their socioeconomic conditions. These same friends will be the first to to say that ""If I can make it, no one has an excuse. And protest isn\'t whats going to solve it"". But it is. Protest, the posts, the kneeling, the hashtags, the articles, the petitions. Actually, every bit contributes to the eradication of oppression. But we can\'t all be jacks of all trades. We have our own individual strengths, some of us are story tellers, some of us are healers, some of us are warriors, etc. Forget the guilt of not doing enough, focus on what makes sense for you and your personal power.\n\nPlease do not comment if your views are radically different. If you do not agree with the basic concept of fighting oppression, you need to keep it moving as it will just be a waste of time - and personal time is precious for new moms ;) All others, you\'re welcome to contribute.', 'I concur that activism can take many forms. I believe opression shoulf be protested against/challenged and I believe that can take many shapes and forms as well. You explained this very well.\n\nCan a person be neutral and still be part of the change? If that person is silent AND neutral then I believe that person is not part of the change.\n\nCan a person who is not neutral stay silent and affect change? Communication is the key element. The silent part would pre-empt any contribution towards change.\n\nIn the face of oppression, silence (lack of communication) does not challenge the oppression.\n\nVerbal communication, nonverbal communication , speeches, kneling during the anthem, signs, marches, and protests all communicate and all facilitate change.\n\nSo do conversations around the water cooler, conversations over the dinner table, and how we vote, these all are actions that initiate change.\n\nWhereing a button for rqual rights, a bumper sticker that black lives matter are actions that have some impact. How much? is uncertain.\n\nBut silence aids the oppresors. Silence affects no change.\n\nJust my opinion.', ""I agree! Though I definitely think there is a potential for people to use protests/activist spaces to express support that is performative without wanting to actualize those ideals. Activism in itself has and can become commodified, unfortunately. And because of this people might use it to increase their social capital. That's their prerogative, of course, and to an extent, everybody does this without intending to. It's something to think about. I still want to involve myself in those spaces, of course, I can't deny the impact it's had.\n\nI think the usual approach should be re-worked.""]","['General Topics', 'Politics & Current Events']",Politics & Current Events

The safe place is to talk about memories, to joke around and discuss other people (... i know..), which I find totally not enough. I always feel I am the smartest and sanest in the room, which tells me I am simply in the wrong room and it drives me crazy.. I don`t want it to be like that. I can imagine finding a new person or two, with whom I can talk about deep stuff and with whom it will feel like our discussion is going somewhere and it`d be satifsying, but I think it`s kind of lame I can no longer do it with my bestfriend(s)...Have you been in such situation? What did you do? :/', ""I know what you mean and it's difficult. In some respects I have it good. My best friend (type unknown, but I would guess ISTJ) is someone I know from high school is a fellow I can have deep conversations with on a variety of topics, including war, ancient history, philosophy, and politics. Likewise, my mom (ENTP) is a good source of conversations on modern history, law, and politics.\n\nI know many more people however who mostly prefer to talk about vapid sorts of topics. They are alright to talk to in short spurts, but I notice when observing them interacting with each other that they naturally gravitate to topics of conversation that are totally unfulfilling to me, e.g. family, vacations, fashion. Since I've noticed that, I have also started to notice that they also do not speak about these issues on as deep a level as I would prefer or as I get from my best friend or my mom. This concerns me, since I spend far more time around these people than I do around those two, which leads to a certain sense of isolation on my part."", ""I am all too aware of these flavors of conversation.\nSorry, I'm not an INTJ.\nIt can sometimes disgust me and I get very bitter. :)"", 'My case is not I can`t have deep conversations with them, before I could, now it`s simply not a good idea, because we`re on different sides - I am pro science and logic and they are conspiracy theorists :X every time we gather we tend to end up in fights because of that... In general they are smart, or were at least, I think they are just brain washed from these trends and youtube, but it seems I can`t do anything at the moment.. I tried and tried but it`s like debating a tree. They don`t even trying to comprehend what I am telling them. The good thing is that my dad in INTJ and that helps A LOT, but seeing my friends degrade into people who lack logic or don`t believe in science or history it`s really fucked up..', 'Sounds like you can use new friends.

I am not saying I blindly believe in everything, I always have in mind that in many cases truth is in the middle, and not everything is black and white.. I tend to believe in hyphothesis which sound crazy but I can connect them somehow to science etc. But basically they refuse to use logical thinking and I don`t know how to communicate with a person who refuse to think..\nP.S. I am very open-minded, if they can give me proofs or explain me why they believe in certian things I could accept them.. but it didn`t happen so far"", '', '', 'It is sad that they\'re pushing conspiracy theories that aren\'t very realistic. Those presentations are the worst ones with only beginner audiences buying into them.

410,475,Weird ISTP,"['I\'m not English, so sorry in advance for any mistake. I\'m an INFP. Me and my ISTP friend are in the same college. He almost never shows up to classes, but keeps texting me and asking me to study together. At the beginning I had the feeling he was just using me to understand math stuff (he doesn\'t know much cause his high school teachers were horrible, but he\'s very smart). It\'s not like he wasn\'t being nice to me, though.\nThere was this one time I was trying to avoid a friend that has a crush on me and used to follow me everywhere and sit next to me on the train every single day. Me and my ISTP friend had just met, but he walked me to a different train station so that I could avoid the boy. At the time he was very quiet, especially when we were with people who wanted to joke/talk ""incessantly"" with me. I usually have that kind of non-stop conversation with everyone, but it never worked with him. Now I know it just isn\'t his style.\n\nWhat was bothering me was the actual result of our (rare) conversations. He used to make jokes without realizing he was being rude, sometimes mock or criticize me until I got mad. For a while I couldn\'t talk to him ""freely"" cause I was scared of being judged again. His actions were SO different, though. He wanted to get together for coffee, take the train with me everytime he could. If I was sitting too close to him, he wouldn\'t do or say anything. I payed for his coffee once and he insisted on paying for mine the next time, and it went on like that. I was pretty confused.\n\nEventually he realized what was going on with me and told me out of the blue that he wanted me to talk more, that he wasn\'t going to judge me and so on. Made it sound like a joke, though.\n\nWe started texting to help each other with math stuff but ended up talking about tv shows and other things as well. He helped me a lot with subjects he\'s good at (and when I say a lot, I mean A LOT. But maybe he just likes to find mistakes and correct them). Sometimes he would lose patience and complain about me, usually about math problems I couldn\'t solve or explain quickly enough, and get me mad again. He even told me he doesn\'t understand how my grades can be so high (!!!). That was SO frustrating!\n\nThen he started getting cold and distant in our everyday meetings but friendly on texts (telling me things about his life, joking, sharing random thoughts and songs, etc). If I wanted to keep the conversation going and ask him something, though, he would avoid the question. If I wanted him to see some funny video or just share something random like he was doing, he would say he doesn\'t care. Like... genuinely doesn\'t care. And I would feel used again.\n\nTwo or three times he told me he never lets any of his friends see his home, but I\'ve been there more than once. He says he doesn\'t like to study with people, but keeps asking me to study with him (even if we ended up doing nothing the time before). Last time we met, he was SO WEIRD. He usually is a very laid-back person but this time he looked excited (?). Joking all the time, smiling, searching for eye-contact, sending a lot of texts and voicemails once I went home. I don\'t know what\'s changed. Maybe he was just having a good day.\n\nMy question is, what is going on? Am I being stupid and missing something obvious, or does he actually tolerate me but doesn\'t know how to treat people like people?', 'Hmmmm.

414,479,Seducing and fucking female ISTP,"[""Hello I'm an unhealthy ENFP who's obsessed with this little cutie tootie ISTP who I just want to cuddle until she screams for air and dies. Sex is only a matter of time (I'm an ENFP), however I wouldn't mind knowing how much I can reveal of my true self without having her getting turned off. I haven't showed her any weirdness, always try to be the hottest guy in the room (you little materialistic fucks <3) and I feel like there should be a third point but there isn't. Also, I do plan on being the best sex partner she ever had/will have, so what type of shit are you guys into?"", ""This is creepy AF! ISTP's have sensitive egos. It won't matter how good looking you are. If you give off the slightest creepy vibe they will be terrified of you and shun you like the plague. As far as I can tell they need the nicest most sensitive man out there. A highly respectful individual. A real gentlemen because they are paranoid conspiracy theorists. Your tricks will work much better on Introverted sensors. We like weird stuff and people, but ISTPs hate weird people. They think they're trying to kill them."", ""Not sure if I ever met an ISTP female, but I think they can handle themselves and others pretty well. Your post makes me smile though, I can relate to the straightforward expressions, to the point where some may find it a bit awkward hehe :D - It takes one to see through all that and appreciate the raw feels and honesty behind it. Besides ... cuddling is super important and one of the best things. Good luck with not scaring her away ^.^ If she gets turned off then there's a better fit for you out there anyway."", 'Good Luck w/ your fantasy, Dude.\n\nChances are pretty good that if there isn?™t more to you than that high, hard one youre stroking, that?™s all she?™ll be before long.\n\nISTPs are not easily deceived and we like to look deep into the people we?™re considering. If there?™s nothing below the surface, we get bored after the novelty wears off and move along.\n\nKinda sux for you because we always leave them wanting more of us.\n\nGood luck.']","['Creators', 'Personality', 'ISTP - Crafter']",ISTP - Crafter

I heard INFP and ISTP are the ideal types--but I more so would like to discover that through personal stories of others.\n\nWhat are things I would need to be prepared for if I were in a friendship/relationship with one?\n\nI am currently best friends with and INFP but they are sometimes a bit cold. Is this normal for an INFP and ENFJ relationship? I actually heard INFP+ENTJ are better--is that true?\n\nCurious curious."", ""I've had moments where my Fe clashes heads rather harshly with my INFP cousin's Fi. I later found out that although we're both Feelers, we really do have different foundations/approaches in regards to how we go about life. She would never do something that went against her feelings and/or identification of self, even if it meant killing or saving a loved one. Then, me, I had become so susceptible to other people's emotions, that I really wandered about everywhere without a proper and well-established sense of self. We had both gone to extremes, and that isn't healthy. Just, please do not put unreasonable expectations on the other, like I did. :) Love what you see the other person has, and admire it. Tell them so whenever you can. Appreciation for differences goes a long way. Even foes turn out to be friends."", ""Typically the matches are always those who are the same 2nd letter and opposite on all others, or same on 2nd and 3rd and opposite on all others. Is it a thing that ISTP and ENFJ go together. I thought it would have been INFP and INTP's go with ENFJ's"", ""My best friend of 12 years is an ISTP.\nHe is one of the hardest, yet most sensitive people I know.\nHe is extremely logical and focuses mainly on real evidence.\nHe has a tendency to make very hard conclusions about people, sometimes based around tiny details that could prove unreliable, and will cut people deeply with relentless logic.\nAnd he laughs at people.\nAnd I've heard surprisingly mean things come from his mouth.\n\nBut my best friend is a special case. He is a very advanced thinker and a monkey goon. He isn't so great at abstract theories but he certainly inhibits his fathers laws of acceptance and tolerance.\n\nOne thing I can confidently say, ISTP's are unlike anyone else you'll meet. It really depends on the specific person. However I have seen a female ENFJ interact with my best friend ISTP before and it seemed to be great chemistry. Certainly the ISTP does not prefer to be an extrovert."", 'I have heard infps are a great match for enfj and as an infp this holds true with a few enfj girlfriends who are very supportive, but I have not been involved romantically with an enfj guy.

I'm curious myself how primary love language may or may not relate to personality type..

Examples of physical quantities are the amounts of money, pieces built, the amount of force or energy required.\nBut when I talk to sales people the quantities tend to be more emotional. If their is a product failure such as a leak I am told ""They leak everywhere."" Their is also the tendency for sales people to use superlative words very often. Superlative words are all, every, never, absolutely, totally, or completely.\nDo you find yourself using MBTI to help develop strategies to deal with different personality types? What are some of the situations and strategies you have used for different personality types?', 'We did an MBTI exercise at work. I am easily overwhelmed by too much extroversion and loud noises, so knowing the types of my coworkers helps significantly in deciding how much interaction I can tolerate and with whom, as well as on a more basic level helping me understand the nature of the problem that I face.', ""Well for me personally it normally comes down to the individual in terms of how I approach and cope with them. However, if I had to generalise it, I'd say it really comes down to the perceiving and judging functions.\n\nFor example, if I get the sense that I am working with fellow judgers, I try to create a temporary plan with them that spans the last few hours of our shift so that everyone knows what to do and who's doing what .and at what time A plan just makes us all feel more comfortable. Yet the more concrete our plan, the easier it'll crumble.\n\nIf I'm working with perceivers I leave them be while I go do the odd jobs that no one likes while they work in the kitchen, or vice versa. The only time we'll make a solid plan is when there are still things that need to be finished within the last hour or so of our shifts, because we all left it to the last minute, but now our restaurant is super busy.\n\nIf I am working with judgers and perceivers (which is most of the time) then we usually have a loose plan that'll look something like this:\n\nPerson A will do X task\nWhen Person A is done, Person B will go on break\nWhen Person B is back from break, Person C will do Y task, then go on break\n\nThe plan is loose enough to adapt, but linear enough for all of us to follow it.\n\nWell that's really all I have on that matter. I hope this helped :)"", 'http://www.raybans-outlet.cc/, http://www.ray-bans.net.co/, http://www.swarovski-canada.ca/, http://www.coach-factoryoutlet.net.co/, http://www.bottegaoutlet.com/, http://www.reebok-shoes.co.uk/, http://www.oakleys-online.com.co/, http://www.adidassuper-star.com.de/, http://www.michaelkorsviponline.com/, http://www.lacosteoutlet.com.co/, http://www.uggsboots.com.de/, http://www.pandora-jewellery.com.es/, http://www.oakleys.com.de/, http://www.ralphlaurens-outlet.net/, http://lions.nfl-jerseys.org/, http://rockets.nbajerseysvip.com/, http://www.nikeshoes.fr/, http://www.nikefreerun-inc.co.uk/, http://www.thomas-sabos.com.de/, http://www.mcm-backpacks.com.co/, http://www.guessfactorys.com/, http://www.raybanvip.com/, http://raptors.nbajerseysvip.com/, http://www.outlet-toryburchshoes.com/, http://www.thomas-sabo.us.com/, http://www.nike-free-runs.de/, http://www.hermesbagsoutlet.com/, http://www.michael-korsbags.com.co/, http://www.jeans-truereligion.com/, http://www.adidas-shoes.com.co/, http://www.converses.us.com/, http://www.longchamp-bagsoutlet.com/, http://www.nike-store.com.de/, http://eagles.nfl-jerseys.org/, http://www.adidasschuhe-online.com.de/, http://www.newiphone-cases.com/, http://www.nikefree5.com.co/, http://hawks.nbajerseysvip.com/, http://www.danskos-shoes.com/']","['General Topics', 'Career & Education']",Career & Education

And I am a little uncertain about your question. How long have the two of you been seeing each other?\n', ""hello @ballista11, I only met him through facebook and we're in the process of getting to know each other stage. It's been a month already since then and it confuses me because he's asking where do i want to go sometime but he never act on it. He's sending me updates about his life every now and then and it confuses me because he's doing it voluntarily. I asked him about my role in his life, he said that he considered me as a friend and it hurts me a little bit. He also asked me about his role in my life and I answered the same because I already thought that he friendzoned me. Honestly, I'm clueless about dating because I tend to analyze and overthink each and every message and reply that he sends to me.\n\nPS. I haven't met him yet in person. He wasn't even asking me about meeting up just yet."", 'Hello @thepanini\n\nI want to be very careful about how I respond. That is why I have taken so much time to consider what you have written.\n\nI will start with the obvious. You have a barrier between you and this person. That barrier is the internet. You only see what that person chooses to present to you. That limits you in terms of what you actually know.\n\nMy suggestion to you is to limit your emotional investment in this person. Stays friends and talk to each other. But do not try to get emotionally close to someone that is not geographically close. This allows you to protect your personal well being.', 'TBH I have the same problem as well, but it\'s been 2 years for me lol. Anyways, me and my INTP got along really well right from the start, but I waited like a year and half before I sat down planned everything out for like 8 hours, then the next day I asked him if he wanted to start dating.\n\nThe nice thing about INTP\'s, in my opinion, is that they\'re so honest and direct.

Yes, you, because there is so much to you, and all of that specialness that is you was designed by Him.\n\nSo all of that being said, God has plans for everyone, and I believe if God is willing, I will someday meet that athletic, intelligent, musical, compassionate, altruistic woman of my dreams... Hopefully she dresses well too... Not that that will really matter 100 years from now, but it will matter for a lot of years before that haha."", 'God Bless you...you are not alone in your practice or beliefs.', ""Hi Joey,\n\nI just wanted to say, I'm an INFJ, brought up a charismatic Christian and....I totally, 100%, get what you are saying.

438,513,Beware of mistypes,"[""So I just quickly wanted to say that I've been debating-arguing over this since my online social presence in typology social forums. Here's the thing I noticed. I tend to criticize society and the general category of 'social people who proactively participate.' Among the many forum users who also identified as Sexual/Secure, aka 'Sx/Sp' or the other 'Social blind spot' type Sp/Sx, I could not find any who would criticize or get annoyed by the social types (according to the definition, we, Social lasts, should). In fact, the social types have mostly never indicated that they were Social-firsts on the forums. And the least were they able to was to reflect on or point out the real-time workings of their Social instinct (in one particular moment). For example, this is a forum, here we socialize, act according to the proper etiquette, present a persona that is palatable to most, yet no one is willing to reflect on that. Noone seems to see or willing to break the herd mentality, this convivial 'love fest' that someone has once called it (perpetuating, amping up positivity, shallow congeniality).\n\nSo my theory is the following. It is known that the 2nd instinct in the stack is the 'creative' one, meaning that people have a relaxed attitude about it, they are not obsessed with it, can show it off, and are okay with revealingly talk about it because that's not their main concern. In this way you could say that Social first types are the ones that are so concerned about fitting in and networking that they write all these 'thinks outside of the box,' 'maverick,' 'goes against social expectations' attributes in their profiles (or 'forget' to mention they are a 'mainstream,' compromising person), but they still never ever catch themselves in the process of appealing to a group, following a larger trend (and say it out loud). They are not able to 'unfollow' the social norms of and not be tactful/polite to their preferred group because a behavior that does not meet the expectations of membership loses its function/power to be social. They cannot think about it, they cannot make it conscious because they are immersed/invested in doing it.\n\nSo I noticed that this subthread has the most topics'n'posts within 'Instincts' and also that they are a lot of people who identify as 'Sx/Sp' on this forum. But I have to say, y'all, actions speak louder than words (Sx also manifests in intimacy, the need for more focused/downnarrowed one-on-one rapport, yet what I see is that people speak directly to each other only in bursts, they don't go deeper, the convo fades out quickly, instead they divide their attention and time between group members, i.e. getting to know a person from the safety of the group - Social/Secure). So please do educate yourselves, read up on diff. authors' definitions because if this site is the most advanced, then basically every dating site is a lie (technological utopia).\n\np.s.: note this post was done also under the pretext of socalizing so as to find a girlfriend, for this author's emotional need and hormones are mighty ablaze this summer."", 'I\'m new to this site. However, I make my account here just to see what is this about dating site. I\'m not interested in finding date partner.

Actually what I did get by this site is, it is pointless. This site better come as a forum instead of a dating site. Why I can say so? Because as I see many people coming from different places around the world. The truth of how can someone had intimate relationship must had to be face-to-face, not this kind of texting. Two ENTPs had texting me only said ""Hi"" then disappeared like you said. This is useless. They barely respond back after I messaged them back. What I get is most people joined in this like me example, just want to test waters, nothing more. They maybe will respond but that if something shiny grabbed their attention, as most just log in if they had time. What I get is most people are not as serious as some, and I don\'t know whether that is good or not. Human beings are complex and can be wrong.

439,514,ESFP INTP friendships,"[""I just wanted to express my appreciation of the ESFP types from the INTP perspective. One of my best friends is ESFP. There are a lot of differences between us, but I think that is the reason that we get along so well.\n\nOne of the things that I do that I recently learned that most INTPs do is that I have discussions or debates within my own head. I may bring other people I know into these discussions in my imagination, because I usually know how those people would respond to the things I say, so I get the benefit of another point of view without the stress of actually having to socialize.\n\nThat being said, I am generally unable to do this with ESFPs. My ESFP friend is the most unpredictable person I know. I never have any idea of what he is going to say, and I absolutely love that. He often brings perspectives I would never have thought of, and no one has ever made me laugh harder than he has.\n\nI think that the way that INTPs and ESFPs generally don't judge others, although the reason behind it is radically different, allows us to accept our deep differences. Also, the ability of an ESFP to work a crowd without inhibition is like a superpower to me. The other day, I decided to embark on an advertising campaign for my business by handing out business cards at the university, and I brought my ESFP friend with me. I was amazed by his ability to walk into a room and just shout for everyone's attention. That is a mutant ability I do not possess, but which proves quite useful.\n\nSo I think every INTP needs an ESFP friend.""]","['Creators', 'Personality', 'ESFP - Performer']",ESFP - Performer

There is something to be said for a better user interface that draws in more visitors. MBTI matching algorithms, however, have built-in shortcomings (as do some others that I've explored.) In several places on PEVO I've shared this old link: http://pstypes.blogspot.com/2009/03/myers-briggs-compatibility-part-1.html . Basically, the MBTI compatibility theories all contradict one another and none of them have been shown to really work, except perhaps anecdotally. That's why I've advocated for a different approach. The original OkCupid was terrific, but it was sold to IAC (Match.com) about ten years ago and it's never been the same since.

Might explain why we are all still out here."", ""TypeTango, a site even older and less active than this one, remains alive. Though less technically sophisticated, it has a few features that I like. I suspect that it used to do more, but perhaps had to rip out some functions than ran afoul of Myers-Briggs and/or Keirsey copyrights.\n\nTypeTango offers no tests these days. It is apparent that very many of its early members were mis-typed ??a problem, perhaps, with whatever test they were using at the time and amplified by the fact that most of their users knew nothing about MBTI. Since then, its users have probably relied on whatever free online tests and instruction that PEVO users find, which produce false results at about the same, still alarming, rate. The posted types are, as often as not, a distraction.\n\nTypeTango has no compatibility algorithm. Search results can be filtered by member age, type, location and recent activity. As an approximation of compatibility, TypeTango allows users to provide dozens of open-ended ?œkeywords????positive and negative. Users can assign a weight to each keyword, but almost no one does. The open-endedness is both a strength and a weakness. Lists of the 100 most popular keywords are provided. This is far too few. Near misses dominate: synonyms; changes in spelling, parts-of-speech, tense or hyphenation; attempts to cram multiple words into one ?œkeyword.?\n\nA few things I like.... TypeTango allows only one new contact per day and tells you to make the most of it. (Ongoing conversations do not count toward this limit.) Users cannot see the date and time that others last signed-on ??only the month and year. There is no ?œViewed Me.??All of these features seem to make the site less attractive to those who might abuse it. It does not ask about educational attainment or profession. (Curiously, it does ask optionally about weight and seems to get mostly ballpark-accurate answers.) That's it. Pretty bare-bones, really. Nice logo. The site seems to have attracted about 25,000 total users 19 years-of-age and older since about 2002.\n\nThere are a few things that an MBTI / Enneagram site really needs to get right, in my opinion:\n\n#1) It needs to attract a large number of users. This usually means that it needs to offer something more than match-based searching to attract users. PEVO's Chatrooms, Groups, Forums, Polls, Meetups and Psychology pages were a valiant and sophisticated (for its time) attempt to add value. PEVO's bulletin-board style home page is also fairly unique. None of this was enough. The original OkCupid offered hundreds of games, including a pretty good MBTI test and another one that assigned a fairly comical but strangely accurate ?œdating persona.??It was great fun. It probably did attract many users but was probably too costly to maintain. The feature was dropped ages ago.\n\n#2) It needs to provide some sort of typing algorithm or a tie-in to a specific other site. The results have to be right and have to be explained in a way that is understandable to an unsophisticated user. Many people are obviously content to hear that their ?œrare??type is the likely reason that they haven't yet met the person of their dreams. Which we know is not true. Let me stress: the results have to be right. In my opinion, all of the historic free online dating sites fall far short, notwithstanding their creators' credentials and/or professed expertise. One way to make the results more valid is to refrain from all the story-telling that usually accompanies the results, describing everything else that is supposedly going on in the lives of typical test-takers of a particular type. That's just astrology. A dating-site test either helps someone find a compatible romantic partner or it fails.\n\n#3) The site needs at least a theory of compatibility. Several of today's best-capitalized online dating sites are using machine learning ??a form of artificial intelligence ??to adjust their algorithms to do ?œwhatever works??(based on still questionable criteria) to improve the predictability of a match. This is far outside the capabilities of most start-ups, and it is not apparent that it helps, anyway. I have posted elsewhere my belief that most of the MBTI-based compatibility algorithms are very weak, purely hypothetical, not objectively tested and contradictory of one another. An enhanced scheme is needed. PEVO's use of Enneagram Instincts was a valuable addition, in my opinion ??one that was never fully exploited here or anywhere else. I also like values-based schemas described above. An algorithm that can adapt to its own successes and failures (based on something more than a swipe) would be better still.\n\n#4) It needs to protect its users from threats ??both institutional and individual ??to their privacy, security and safety. Too many users still give away far too much information. The site has to be better at protecting them than they are themselves ??without losing their interest.\n\nA web site or app that does all these things hasn't yet been built.""]","['General Myers Briggs', 'Personality']",Personality
